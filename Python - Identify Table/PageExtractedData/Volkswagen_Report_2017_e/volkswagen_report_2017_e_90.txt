automatically met. The whistleblower system guarantees the greatest 
possible protection for both whistleblowers themselves and the 
 people affected, and follows strict rules to ensure that the process is 
fair, transparent and swift.  
Both employees and third parties can report possible breaches to the 
Volkswagen Group’s national and international employee representa-
tive bodies, or to national and international trade union federations.
As part of our Sustainability in Supplier Relations program, we raise 
our employees’ awareness of and provide them with continuous 
training in issues relating to human rights, risks and trends, as well 
as the principles enshrined in our Group-wide Code of Conduct. We 
are currently also conducting an in-depth review of the human rights 
section of our Code of Conduct. We use real-life examples of potential 
human rights violations to illustrate the individual issues and help 
employees put the Code of Conduct’s rules into practice. Informing 
and training employees at all levels in our companies is an essential 
part of our compliance efforts. 
Further information on the whistleblower system, our code of conduct and  
our sustainability in supplier Relations concept can be found in sections:  
– Risk management 
– compliance

CONFLICT MINERALS
We also believe we have a special responsibility to protect groups along 
our supply chain who are potentially at high risk of human rights 
abuses. Our supplier management therefore includes due diligence 
guidance for building responsible supply chains of minerals from 
conflict-affected and high-risk areas.
