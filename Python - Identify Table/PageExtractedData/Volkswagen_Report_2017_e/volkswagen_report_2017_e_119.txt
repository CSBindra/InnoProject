As part of optimizing the entire value chain in the most holistic way, 
we aim to minimize the environmental impact of our vehicles by work-
ing closely with our suppliers. This is why Volkswagen joined the CDP 
Supply Chain Program (SCP) back in 2015. In addition, we seek to stay 
in direct contact with our suppliers by organizing targeted workshops 
in which we jointly discuss and develop innovative approaches to the 
environmental optimization of components and processes.
In 2016, we used the CDP SCP to send out a questionnaire to 119 sup-
pliers. We received comprehensive responses from 83% of them – 13% 
more than the average response rate in the SCP.
This year, the CDP evaluated the “Ability” of the 3,300 participating 
companies to make contact with their suppliers. On a scale from A to 
D, Volkswagen achieved an A- ranking, versus an average rating of C-. 
The ranking was based on an analysis of the answers to the question-
naire.

the more detailed Sustainability sections of our brands and regions.
 
Through our involvement in national and international industry and 
sector associations, we continue to work with other automotive man-
ufacturers to create shared communication platforms with the aim of 
driving forward sustainability in the supply chain.
PEOPLE AND RESPONSIBILITY
Once a year, Volkswagen honors its highest-achieving trainees across
