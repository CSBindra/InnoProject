WATER
Conserving our planet’s freshwater reserves is one of the  pivotal 
 requirements for preserving the basic necessities of life. Water 
resources are already scarce in many parts of the world, and access 
to clean drinking water is an increasingly pressing problem for 
large  sections of the global population. During our products’ use 
phase, water consumption only plays a minor role. The supply chain 
is a  significant consumer of water, however, especially during the 
extraction or creation of raw materials. We have no direct influence 
over this upstream phase. Consequently, to reduce our water con­
sumption, we are focusing on areas which we can influence directly: 
our production plants. Our latest review indicates that 55% (around 
22  million m³) of our entire freshwater consumption is attributable 
to sites located in regions where groundwater resources are at risk. 
The water management strategy adopted by the Corporate Environ­
ment & Energy Steering Committee defines four areas of activity:  
 § ensuring safe, reliable water supply and disposal by protecting 
groundwater resources from pollutants, 
 § using water efficiently throughout the product life cycle by imple­
menting closed loops, 
 § engaging in social and environmental projects to protect water 
resources and promote public environmental awareness, 
 § enhancing transparency by supporting the CEO Water Mandate 
and the CDP Water Disclosure Project. In 2017, we were included 
on the CDP Water A­List. The list includes those companies which 
were identified over the last CDP reporting year as global leaders 
in sustainable water management. 
Our in­house White Paper defines key requirements for the vari­
ous processes in our production sequence. These requirements are 
helping us implement sustainable, water­efficient processes across the 
entire Group.

Depending on where wastewater is purified, we make a distinction 
between locations that act as so­called “indirect dischargers” by 
discharging wastewater into municipal sewers for further purification, 
and those that act as so­called “direct dischargers” by treating their 
own wastewater in­house and then discharging the purified waste­
water directly into a body of water.
The absolute demand for freshwater in our Group has risen over the 
last few years. This is due not only to the inclusion of new locations in 
our reporting system, but also to the growing numbers of passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles we are manufacturing. On the other 
hand, freshwater consumption per vehicle has steadily declined since 
2010, thanks to a raft of recycling initiatives and the introduction of 
manufacturing techniques that use minimal water. In 2017, we were 
able to reduce water consumption per vehicle to 3.76 m³ from 3.89 m³ 
in 2016.
