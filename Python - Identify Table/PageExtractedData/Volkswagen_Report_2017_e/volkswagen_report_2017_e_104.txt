The moderate use of temporary work represents an essential 
flexibility instrument for Volkswagen. The principles of our 
Charter on Temporary Work serve to ensure appropriate condi-
tions of employment and remuneration for temporary external 
personnel and the standardized use of temporary work as an 
instrument across the Volkswagen Group. Volkswagen does not 
use external personnel to replace its own employees. Contracts 
for work and services are an essential instrument for meeting 
special personnel requirements (such as specific knowledge). 
The use of contracts for work and services is a normal proce-
dure. Volkswagen concludes such contracts for example with 
companies from the trades who are engaged in building work 
at the factories, with companies who supply, maintain and re-
pair plant and equipment, with cleaning firms, as well as with 
iT and development companies in order to access their specific 
knowledge. Volkswagen attaches great importance to ensuring 
that the Group's high social standards are integrated into its 
supplier management. We take reports of possible violations 
seriously and follow them up. if violations are determined, we 
ensure they do not recur.
