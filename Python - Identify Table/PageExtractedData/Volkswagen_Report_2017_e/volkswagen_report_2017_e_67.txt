In the passenger cars and light commercial vehicles category, rising 
production volumes since 2010 have resulted in an increase in the 
total volume of hazardous waste, while the total volume of non­ 
hazardous waste has declined. Similarly, we were able to reduce the 
volume of waste for disposal per vehicle from 15.2 kg in 2016 to 
13.2 kg in 2017. This represents a 43.3% reduction compared with 
the 2010 baseline.
Consequently, the proportion of waste for recycling – excluding 
 metallic waste – rose from around 66% in 2010 to around 81% in 2017. 
This increase in the proportion of recycled waste is also the result of 
the waste management strategy adopted within our Group, which 
aims to improve waste recycling rates.
The absolute quantity of metallic “recyclable waste materials” has also 
risen due to increased production volumes across the Group since 
the start of the reporting period in 2010. However, in 2017 we were 
able to reduce the volume per vehicle by 4% compared to 2010. Power 
stations operated by Volkswagen Kraftwerk GmbH inevitably produce 
power plant residues. In the last reporting year, we were able to recycle 
around 130,000 t of these residues.

the share attributable to other Group divisions. This is not depicted for the other fractions, 
however, due to their minimal share in these amounts.

VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS  
Coating processes are the main producers of VOC emissions.  Modern 
paintshops use coating and process materials containing fewer sol­
vents. During coating processes, we also take steps to collect and/or 
eliminate any solvents emitted. To do this, we usually use a procedure 
involving thermal afterburning of the exhaust air downstream of the 
actual coating process. 
Despite the increase in vehicle production since 2010 and the asso­
ciated increase in the number of coating operations, we were able to 
reduce absolute VOC emissions by 26.0%. We have also significantly 
reduced emissions per vehicle since 2010, by 49.4%.
