Products and Production  |  energy, co?  and cLiMate change  
Increased production volumes and downstream procedures for the 
thermal afterburning of VOC emissions from paint shops resulted in 
higher consumption of gases used to fuel manufacturing processes. 
This went hand in hand with a slight deterioration in the specific 
value per vehicle.
