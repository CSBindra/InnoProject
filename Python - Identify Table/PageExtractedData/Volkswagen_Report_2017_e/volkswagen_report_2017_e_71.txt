The Volkswagen Group can look back on a long tradition of cultivating responsible  
relationships with our employees and our neighbors, as well as responding to the  
concerns of society as voiced by people outside the company. Through initiatives such  
as the 4-day week in the 1990s, which effectively rescued 30,000 jobs, or the creation of 
4,200 new jobs for the unemployed in 2002 as part of our Auto5000 program, we have 
repeatedly demonstrated our commitment to and equal prioritization of commercial 
competitiveness, job security and corporate social responsibility
