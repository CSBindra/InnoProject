We welcome the ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate 
change, which aims to limit global warming to less than 2°C above 
pre­industrial levels. Referring to international climate agreements, 
our CEO Matthias Müller is calling upon the automotive industry to 
ensure that all fleet CO? emissions “are steadily reduced to zero by 
2050.”  
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CO? EMISSIONS
To reduce energy consumption and CO? emissions across the Group, 
we are relying on a combination of measures, including improved en­
ergy efficiency, the use of gas instead of coal for power generation, and 
the procurement of electricity from renewable sources. We now meet 
around 37% of our global electricity requirements from renewables.
Our most effective lever for reducing our global carbon footprint is 
to optimize CO? emissions from our vehicle fleet. After all, according 
to the Scope 3 GHG Inventory, 74% of all CO? emissions are produced 
during the use phase.
And this does not take into account direct CO? emissions from our 
company cars. We are currently working on standardizing the meth­
ods used to record emissions from our company­car fleet worldwide. 
The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet in the EU (excluding 
Lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average of 122 g CO?/km* over 
the reporting period – well below the European limit of 130 g CO?/
km applied in 2017. The slight increase compared with the previous 
year is mainly due to the new measurement procedures that must be 
used, and the decline in the proportion of diesel­vehicle deliveries. As 
small­volume manufacturers, the Lamborghini and Bentley brands 
each have an independent fleet for the purposes of the European CO? 
legislation; Bentley complied with its individual target, Lamborghini 
was slightly above its target. 
CO? emissions from the Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet 
outside the EU break down as follows:
In the USA, the fleet emissions figure is 163.1 g CO?/km (Audi/VW 
calendar year; not including Volkswagen of America (VWoA)), in 
China 149.6 g CO?/km (Volkswagen Group (Import) Co. Ltd. (VGIC) + 
Shanghai Volkswagen (SVW) + First Automotive Works (FAW­VW)), and 
in Brazil 129 g CO?/km.

CO? fleet monitoring statistics.

defined in EU Regulation 443/2009 (“NEDC test cycle”).

As a result of a continuous rise in production volumes, our overall 
energy consumption has increased since 2010. At the same time, 
we have been able to reduce our energy consumption per vehicle by 
–17.9% since 2010, from 2,519 kWh to 2,069 kWh. Over the past year, 
we have reduced energy consumption per vehicle by –1.0% compared 
with the previous year.
Our overall consumption of electrical energy has risen in comparison 
with 2010, even though we have taken various efficiency­enhancing 
measures to successfully reduce our electricity consumption per 
vehicle since 2010.
Heat consumption is subdivided into space heating demand for 
production and non­production areas in manufacturing facilities, and 
heating demand for technical processes. Since space heating accounts 
for the greater proportion of the total heating demand, weather con­
ditions have a major impact on trends in overall heating demand. Our 
absolute heat consumption has risen slightly since 2010.
