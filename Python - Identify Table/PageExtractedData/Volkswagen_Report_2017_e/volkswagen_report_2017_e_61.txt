Since 2011, VW Kraftwerk GmbH has been investing in the ongoing 
development of renewables and the construction of highly efficient 
combined heat and power (CHP) plants driven by natural gas. Thus in 
the period to 2016, the company invested around €26 million in renew­
ables such as wind farms and photovoltaic power plants. As part of 
our fuel conversion strategy, VW Kraftwerk GmbH also invested some 
€15 million in a CHP plant in Braunschweig and some €65 million in a 
gas and steam turbine (combined­cycle) plant in Kassel. Furthermore, 
in addition to the company’s own electricity generation activities, we 
are already implementing an increasingly widespread energy pro­
gram for the Volkswagen Group’s production sites in Germany using 
carbon­neutral Volkswagen Naturstrom®. The electricity is generated 
from 100 % renewable energy sources. It is backed up by certificates 
of origin, validated for each user by the German Federal Environment 
Agency (UBA). Contractual agreements have already been signed for 
supplying Volkswagen Naturstrom® to other sites. Over the next few 
years, VW Kraftwerk GmbH will also be looking to invest in new com­
bined­cycle power plants in Wolfsburg, and in the further development 
of renewables.
As an example of such development, once we have received approval 
for the construction and operation of certified wind power plants with 
a total capacity of 12.8 MW at our MAN Salzgitter site, we are planning 
to take part in the Renewable Energy Act (EEG) tendering process in 
2018. Once our bid has been accepted under the EEG tendering pro­
cess, we can start to build the wind farm.
Despite the inclusion of new production sites (along with the associat­
ed increase in energy consumption), direct CO? emissions in the cars 
and light commercial vehicles category, and indeed across the Group 
as a whole, have been falling since 2010. 
Direct CO? emissions are associated with the combustion of fossil 
fuels, the use of which we have successfully reduced. This reduction in 
the absolute volume of emissions goes hand in hand with the decline 
in direct CO? emissions per vehicle since 2010.

CO? emissions (Scope 1 and 2) have fallen since 2010, thanks to 
improved energy efficiency and a reduced­carbon energy supply. As 
a result, we have been able to reduce CO? emissions per vehicle by 
–26.1% since 2010, from 1,096 kg to 810 kg of CO?. Last year alone, 
we were able to reduce CO? emissions per vehicle by –8.3% compared 
with the previous year.
Volkswagen AG operates power stations and boiler plants, which gen­
erate heat and electricity for production facilities owned by Volkswa­
gen AG and third parties. CO? emissions from these power stations 
and boiler plants are included in the total CO? emissions figure for our 
Group by assessing the heat and energy consumption of our produc­
tion facilities using suitable CO? emission factors.

We have not taken direct CO? emissions from company cars and 
official works vehicles into account. We are currently working on 
standardized methods for recording emissions from our company­car 
fleet around the world. Preliminary calculations for Volkswagen 
Deutschland and Audi indicate a 2.6% increase in total CO? emissions 
in the footprint under investigation. 
Not shown here are Group carbon offset projects equating to 6,577 t of 
CO? reductions.
On the other hand, the stated CO? emissions do not include emissions 
produced by Volkswagen AG power plants in the course of supplying 
district heating or power to third parties. In 2016, these emissions 
amounted to 379,516 t of CO?.
