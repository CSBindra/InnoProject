VOLKSWAGEN GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
About this RepoRt
REPORT STRUCTURE
The Volkswagen Group is committed to providing transparency to 
all its stakeholder groups. For the first time, this Group Sustainability 
Report 2017 includes a combined separate nonfinancial report that 
complies with sections 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 of the Handels-
gesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code), hereinafter referred to 
as the “nonfinancial report”. The nonfinancial report serves to meet 
the disclosure requirements of the CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz 
(CSR-RUG – German CSR Directive Implementation Act).   
In the Group Sustainability Report, all text passages, tables and  
graphics that form part of the nonfinancial report are indicated by a 
gray background. The Group Sustainability Report 2017 is supplemented 
by a detailed description of the sustainability activities of our brands 
and regions and of the Volkswagen Group’s CSR projects. This additional 
information, which does not form part of the nonfinancial report, can 
be found on the Volkswagen Group’s corporate website at:  
www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting 
Information on conflicting sustainability objectives and the “diesel 
issue” may be found in our separate sustainability magazine, Shift 2017. 
The publication is available here: www.volkswagenag.com > 
 Sustainability > Shift.
