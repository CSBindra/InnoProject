ENHANCING EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS AND 
 TARGETED ADVANCEMENT PROGRAMS 
To Volkswagen, a family-aware human resources policy represents one 
of the key qualities of an attractive employer and is an important lever 
for ensuring greater gender equality. Accordingly, we are continuously 
working to develop family-friendly working time  models and increase 
the proportion of women in management roles. 
As a voluntary undertaking, the Group first proposed  differentiated 
targets for the proportion of female employees in our German work-
force back in 2011. The following principle applies: we recruit the best 
graduates from each year in the required disciplines, taking as our 
starting point the proportion of female graduates on each course. 
When all the courses of relevance to Volkswagen are averaged out, 
these differentiated quotas produce a female graduate recruitment 
target of 30%.

Bringing more qualified women into the company will enable us to 
steadily increase the percentage of female executives over the coming 
years. 
As part of the revitalization of our corporate culture, in 2017 we also 
focused our efforts on implementing a specific diversity manage-
ment approach. This drive centers around binding quotas stipulated 
for women in managerial positions and targets for the international 
composition (internationality) of our management boards. These two 
figures are combined in our diversity index, which has been in force 
since 1 January 2017. The diversity index forms part of our human 
resources strategy and applies throughout the Volkswagen Group. We 
use the index as a tool for measuring and managing the implemen-
tation of our equal opportunities and internationality targets for top 
management. The calculation is based on current workforce figures. 
In 2017, the proportion of women in management positions was 
13.8%; we are targeting 20.2% by 2025. We are also aiming to increase 
the internationality of our top management level from 18.7% in the 
financial year just ended to 25.0% by 2025. These targets are decided 
by the Group’s Board of Management and are binding for the whole 
organization. 
As well as introducing systematic diversity management, as required 
by German law we have also defined targets for the percentage of 
female managers at Volkswagen AG. In tune with Germany’s law on 
equal participation for women and men in executive positions, 
Volkswagen AG has set itself targets for increasing the proportion of 
women in management by the end of 2021: 13% on the first level of 
management and 16.9% on the second level. As at 31 December 2017, 
the proportion of women in the active workforce on the first level 
of management was 10.4% (2016: 9.8%), while on the second level the 
proportion was 14.0% (2016: 13.5%).
