Strategy and 
Management
As one of the world’s largest industrial corporations, our Group bears a  
special social responsibility. We wish to put our creative powers to good use  
for the benefit of people and the environment. Every year we produce more than 
10 million vehicles. This gives rise to positive effects – such as new jobs,  
regional prosperity and individual opportunities for participation – but also to  
negative impacts, due above all to emissions and resource consumption. And in 
 view of the growing trend toward digitalization, we will be obliged to confront  
new issues in the future – what we do with our customers’ data, for example,  
how we ensure this data is secure and protected at all times, and what legal and  
ethical quandaries are raised by automated driving.
