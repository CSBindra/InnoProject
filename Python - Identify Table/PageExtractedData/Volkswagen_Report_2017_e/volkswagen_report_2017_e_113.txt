404-1 Average hours of training per year per

80 Vocational education and training to the highest standards 
form a vital basis for the specialist knowledge and skills of our 
employees and thus also for the top quality of our products 
and the long-term commercial success of the Volkswagen 
Group. The specific qualification requirements of each individu-
al employee are derived from the competency requirements 
of the respective Berufsfamilie (professional family) and are 
identified at almost all of the Group's brands and companies 
at least once a year through the individual employee appraisal 
or qualification appraisal. The focus here is above all on the 
specialist content, the appropriate form of communicating this 
content and, in particular, the marked integration of theory 
and practice.

Annual Report 2017: 
 Objectives for the composition
There is enormous potential within the diversity of the 
Volkswagen Group workforce. As we move towards becoming 
top employer in the automotive sector, we want to make use 
of this potential by explicitly advancing women, improving 
the scope for combining work and family, and making full use 
of the cultural diversity that exists within the Group. in our 
experience a breakdown by minority group membership is not 
a relevant indicator.
