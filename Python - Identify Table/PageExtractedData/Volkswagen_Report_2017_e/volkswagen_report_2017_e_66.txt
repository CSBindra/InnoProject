Wastewater volumes show a similar trend to the volume of freshwater 
consumption. Differences in freshwater and wastewater volumes are 
caused by evaporation losses from cooling towers and in the manufac­
turing process. We have been able to reduce the volume of wastewater 
per car and light commercial vehicle produced by 22% since 2010, 
from 3.76 m³ to 2.92 m³ in 2017.

WASTE
Making steadily more efficient use of resources means concentrating 
on avoidance, recovery and recycling – for example by introducing 
intelligent concepts for a closed­loop economy. 
As part of our waste strategy, we aim to use materials and products 
more and more efficiently, thereby reducing the volume of waste 
per unit manufactured and recycling any unavoidable waste to high 
 standards. Specifically, this entails:  
 § Avoiding waste generation by optimizing production and ancillary 
processes and/or increasing material utilization levels (material 
efficiency),
 § Reducing waste volumes by localizing waste treatment at our sites,
 § Prioritizing waste recycling and reducing the amount of waste for 
disposal. 
To optimize our waste management, we are making great efforts to 
use digital waste management systems across all our divisions. Such 
systems are already used to control waste management processes in 
all German factories and some of the other European factories oper­
ated by the Volkswagen, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Porsche, 
Audi, MAN and Scania brands, and to facilitate the state­monitored 
disposal of hazardous waste in particular (Electronic Government). 
We are planning to roll out these systems in the rest of Europe and 
subsequently across regions around the world.
In 2015, we introduced waste disposal audits at many of our sites, 
in order to review our waste management and recycling processes. 
For these audits, we jointly developed a standardized procedure in 
collaboration with other vehicle manufacturers (original equipment 
manufacturers or OEMs) and major suppliers. Since then, we have 
been carrying out regular audits of locations and OEMs in Germany 
and the rest of Europe. In the regions, we have also started monitoring 
waste disposal services by introducing audits. We trained potential 
 auditors at our sites in eastern Europe, Spain and Portugal with the 
aim of setting a common benchmark for the quality standards ex­
pected of waste disposal services, carrying out quality­assured audits, 
and ensuring that the results can also be used by other OEMs and 
suppliers. 
Waste from production, logistics and workshops, as well as the 
Technical Development department, is recycled to high standards. 
For the recycling of potentially lucrative waste such as paper, plastics, 
wood or metals (described internally as recyclable waste materials), 
our  Procurement function has rolled out a Group­wide system that 
improves safety throughout the entire process.
