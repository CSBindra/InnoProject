In the context of health, sustainability means ensuring that,  ideally, 
every employee is still healthy when they retire. Protecting and 
 promoting employees’ health is a priority for the company, shared by 
both management and employee representatives. As part of our 
strategy process, we have launched our own Group health initiative. 
During its very first year, the initiative had developed and imple-
mented some basic concepts relating to prevention, workplace health 
management and ergonomics throughout the Group. The aims of 
the health initiative are clearly defined: to improve employees’ quality 
of life, reduce stress, avoid chronic illnesses and consequently also 
boost employees’ performance and reduce absenteeism.

IMPROVING OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
Like preventive healthcare and emergency health provision, the con-
tinuous improvement of occupational safety is vitally important to 
us. As long ago as 2004, the Volkswagen Group drew up an occupa-
tional safety policy which is binding on all Group companies around 
the globe. The same high standards of work organization and occu-
pational safety apply worldwide. For this purpose, in 2010 the Group 
launched its own occupational safety management system (KAMS). 
This system is used to analyze the organizational structures and pro-
cesses for occupational safety at all participating Group companies. 
The findings are held in a central database with Group-wide access. 
To improve information sharing, in recent years the exchange of 
reports on serious and fatal accidents within the Group has been 
introduced. This enables us to take specific action to prevent similar 
accidents across all our sites in the future. Since 2012, Volkswagen 
in Germany has also been running mandatory occupational safety 
training modules for all prospective managers. The group leader 
 qualification modules have likewise been standardized so that occu-
pational safety forms a mandatory part of basic group leader training. 
As a result, we have successfully managed to keep the accident fre-
quency in our companies at a consistently low level.

the accident frequency index is a measure of the frequency with which 
accidents at work occurred in relation to the total number of hours 
worked. the formula for calculating the index is: number of occupational 
accidents, multiplied by 1 million, divided by the number of hours worked.
the accident severity index indicates how serious the accidents were 
by calculating the ratio of the total number of lost working days to the 
number of hours worked. the formula for calculating the index is: number 
of working days lost, multiplied by 1 million, divided by the number of 
hours worked.

For manufacturing companies in particular, sickness-related absences 
from the workplace are not only a significant cost factor, they also pre-
sent major logistical challenges when planning, for example, shift rotas. 
increased availability of diagnostic and screening measures can help 
reduce absenteeism. the working time lost to the company is calculated 
using the following formula: days of absence x 100/payment-relevant 
days i.e. days when employees are expected to be at work.
