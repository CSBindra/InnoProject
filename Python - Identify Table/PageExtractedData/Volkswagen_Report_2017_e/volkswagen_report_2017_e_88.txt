Strategic Objective: 
First-Rate HR Organization
All the objectives and activities described here require a solid foun-
dation. As a company, we believe only strong personnel management 
focused on the interests of both the company and our employees can 
provide the basis for good work policies in an environmentally and 
socially responsible enterprise.
Highly skilled and qualified HR staff are crucial for implementing 
human resources policies that motivate people to perform their best. 
Accordingly, our final strategic objective is to continuously improve 
our HR organization. The goal we have set ourselves is ambitious – 
to shape and support all upcoming change and transformation pro-
cesses in the company, without ever losing sight of our objective of 
creating highly productive, people-friendly working environments.
To attain this vision, we are currently improving the organization of 
our personnel management function. Future efforts will center firstly 
on the digital transformation of work processes, and secondly on 
realigning personnel management.
Our “Empower to transform” human resources strategy formulates 
our previous personnel management objectives in more detail. Not 
only will we ensure that our top teams have the requisite skills; in 
collaboration with our specialist departments we will work on laying 
the foundations for enabling the teams to achieve their full potential – 
among other things by bolstering their ability to continually adapt to 
constantly changing circumstances.
