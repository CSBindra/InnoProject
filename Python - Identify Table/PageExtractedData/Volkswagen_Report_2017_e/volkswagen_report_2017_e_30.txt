The specific content of the action areas in terms of objectives, values 
and indicators is still being fleshed out as part of the implementation 
of our new Group strategy. 
Our relationships with our stakeholders, as well as their requirements, 
expectations and attitudes, are of fundamental importance in identi-
fying issues of material significance for the Volkswagen Group. For this 
reason, in addition to our established Stakeholder Panel and the stake-
holder surveys carried out by the Group companies, we have worked 
with other internal and external representatives to further refine our 
key action areas.
The graphic below shows the Group’s most important action areas in 
the view of our stakeholders. Our desk research focused on the inter-
ests of more than 40 national and international stakeholder groups 
whose concerns formed part of a multi-stage analysis which informed 
the identification of our action areas:
* This analysis is based on the action areas defined in 2015 and stakeholder perspectives at that time.
