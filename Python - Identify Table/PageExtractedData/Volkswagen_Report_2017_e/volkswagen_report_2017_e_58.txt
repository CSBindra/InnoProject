ALTERNATIVE FUELS  
Decarbonization begins with the type of fuel used. We are already in a 
position to use so­called “reduced­carbon” fuels across all our brands. 
The practical suitability of these fuels for use in combustion engines 
has already been comprehensively demonstrated, and in  certain fields 
their use is already regarded as state of the art. They make it  possible 
to achieve almost carbon­neutral long­distance  mobility while 
simultaneously reducing other exhaust emissions (such as NOX and 
particulate emissions). Reduced­carbon fuels include biofuels (spe­
cifically, second­generation biofuels) and synthetic fuels (sometimes 
known as e­fuels) manufactured using hydrogen electrolysis powered 
by electricity from renewable sources.
By using compressed natural gas (CNG) for transportation purposes, 
that is, using methane as a fuel, we offer our customers an immediately 
available and affordable drive technology that supports sustainable 
mobility based on the combustion engine. With a broad pallet of 
CNG­powered models in the passenger car and commercial vehicle 
sectors, we are a market­influencing technology leader in this field. 
Just by using the fossil natural gas (methane) already available in the 
global gas network, we could cut CO? emissions by up to 25% com­
pared with today’s gasoline engines – while at the same time signifi­
cantly reducing exhaust­gas emissions. And over the next few years, 
the use of biogas or e­gas (synthetic gas produced using electricity 
from renewable sources) could make CNG mobility almost entirely 
carbon­neutral.
A number of projects within the Volkswagen Group and among our 
brands, such as the Audi “Power­to­Gas” project (a power­to­gas plant 
in Werlte) and the SEAT “SMART Green Gas” (waste­to­gas) project are 
producing reduced­carbon fuels (biofuels, e­fuels) and renewable gas 
(biogas, e­gas).
Our Group is also exploring significant synergies with e­mobility 
through “sector coupling”, meaning the joint use of energy sources in 
the power generation, heat and mobility sectors.

– SEAT | smart green gas

For heavy commercial vehicles like trucks and buses in particular, 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) is an economical and clean alternative, 
because its high energy density is ideal for long­distance applications.
However, in order for natural gas to become a widely usable energy 
source, better infrastructural conditions are needed. For example, 
natural­gas filling station networks are only sufficiently developed in 
a few countries.

Under Audi’s leadership, we are also investigating hydrogen (H?) as an 
energy source. We have been working on fuel­cell technology – used 
to transform H? into electrical energy in the vehicle – for more than 
15 years. While operating our test fleets, we have gathered extensive 
practical experience of suitable powertrains. One of the key factors 
required for H? to succeed is a suitable refueling infrastructure. Based 
on what we know at present, H? will not be widely available as a fuel 
in the medium term. For this to be possible, hydrogen filling stations 
and plants for producing hydrogen as a renewable energy source must 
first be developed. For this reason, we are actively involved in the H? 
Mobility project, the aim of which is the systematic development of an 
H? infrastructure in Germany. We will make the decision on whether 
to use H? in production vehicles on the basis of market demand and 
infrastructure.
