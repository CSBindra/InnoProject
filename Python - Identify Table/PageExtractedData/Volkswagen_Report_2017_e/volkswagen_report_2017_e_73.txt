At the same time as planning the socially responsible, systematic 
transformation of our human resources function, we are investing 
heavily in training and upskilling programs to carry our workforce 
forward into the digital future. We are continually expanding our 
preventive healthcare offerings. 
Volkswagen is also set to roll out a diversity management system across 
the entire Group by 2020. Different cultural circumstances in global 
markets and increasingly dynamic economic conditions mean that we 
need an ever-broader range of experiences, world views, problem-solv-
ing approaches and ideas for products. The growing diversity of our 
workforce offers potential for innovation which could be leveraged 
even more effectively in future.
Our human resources strategy also addresses the causes and conse-
quences of the diesel emissions issue. Various initiatives for transform-
ing our corporate culture are already in progress, aiming to establish 
flatter hierarchies, a more open form of collaboration and a more 
broadly entrepreneurial perspective across the Group’s divisions. 
Volkswagen’s personnel development system underwent a thorough 
review in 2017; it now provides more transparent routes into manage-
ment with a greater emphasis on individual responsibility. At the same 
time, our management principles were revised and new criteria for 
appointments to management positions were defined.
In the course of 2017 we also revised our Group-wide Code of Conduct, 
further expanded the compliance system and continued the rollout of 
the Code of Cooperation as key pillars of Group-wide cooperation. 
We are implementing our strategy in nine Group-wide strategic 
initiatives which form the key operationalization tools for our human 
resources program. These initiatives are systematically aligned with our 
five principal strategic action areas.
