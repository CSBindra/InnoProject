GRi 401: employment 2017
401-1 new employee hires and employee 
turnover 
75 The selection and recruitment of new employees is undertaken 
in line with their qualifications and suitability. Age is not a 
consideration in this process. Another control metric is the 
 recruitment of women. When recruiting university graduates 
we take our lead from the proportion of women graduates 
on the degree courses relevant for Volkswagen. As an average 
across all such courses this gives us a recruitment target of 
30% of female graduates. As a matter of principle, Volkswagen 
also supports the employment and qualification of local 
 people, both at existing locations and when establishing 
new ones.
