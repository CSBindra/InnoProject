In line with the Scope 3 standards published by the World  Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World 
Resources Institute (WRI), we report CO? emissions for 12 out of a 
total of 15 Scope 3 categories. Our calculations have revealed that the 
“Purchased goods and services” and “Use phase” emission categories 
account for around 92% of all Scope 3 emissions. CO? emissions in 
the use phase are calculated on the basis of a Group fleet value repre­
senting the global vehicle population in the four major regions (EU28, 
USA, Brazil and China). In order to provide as complete a picture as 
possible, we also collect data on emissions in this category that are 
produced during the production and transportation of fuels (“well to 
tank” emissions).

In our quest to improve our environmental performance, we do not 
limit our efforts to the interiors of our production facilities, we also 
look at our Group real estate as a whole. In 2017, Volkswagen Immo­
bilien GmbH formulated a holistic sustainability model. Not only does 
the model focus on the entire life cycle of each property, including 
construction, operation and maintenance; it also examines how each 
asset is funded. By taking this holistic approach, we aim to make a 
significant contribution to the Group’s strategy. We would also like to 
take a leading role in the residential real­estate sector as a sustainable 
investor in the region. In 2017, we completed a number of construc­
tion projects that complied with our own “Blue Building” sustainability 
standard and subsequently leased them in full.

sustainable building approaches can be found at:
