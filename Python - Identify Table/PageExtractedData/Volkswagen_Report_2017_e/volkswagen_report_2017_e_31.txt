In view of our broad international standing, we have deliberately 
avoided any prioritization of these action areas. On the one hand, the 
relevance of the individual areas may vary by region; on the other 
hand, we do not wish to judge, for example, whether the health of over 
640,000 employees worldwide is more important than, for example, 
resource conservation throughout the vehicle life cycle – or vice versa. 
As we understand it, sustainable development means taking equal 
account of economic, environmental and social interests and main-
taining an appropriate balance between them.

As an automobile manufacturer with 12 brands and 120 production 
sites, offering vehicles in 153 countries, we are confronted with a 
broad spectrum of requirements, expectations and attitudes on a 
daily basis. In addition to the opportunities presented by our rela-
tionships with our stakeholders, this diversity of interests is also a 
challenge, because it can result in conflicting objectives.
Stakeholders are individuals, groups or organizations who influence 
or are influenced by our corporate decision-making processes and/
or their outcomes. At the center of our stakeholder universe are our 
customers and employees. Based on those with whom we regularly 
come into contact, we have identified 12 additional stakeholder groups 
surrounding this core, all of whom are given equal priority.
