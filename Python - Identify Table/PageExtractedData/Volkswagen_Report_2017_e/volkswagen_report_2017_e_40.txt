In addition to 62 ad-hoc cases, our Internal Audit function uncov-
ered an additional 31 cases in the reporting period which resulted in 
measures being agreed with suppliers. These cases involved supplier 
conduct that failed to comply with regulatory or contractual require-
ments, which was either reported by individuals or discovered in the 
course of regular program audits.
In addition, both employees and third parties can address possible 
cases of non-compliance via the Volkswagen Group’s employee rep-
resentation bodies or trade union associations, as well as through the 
Volkswagen Group’s ombudsman system.
As a result of these audits and the above-mentioned ad-hoc cases,  
16 business relationships were terminated in the reporting period.
