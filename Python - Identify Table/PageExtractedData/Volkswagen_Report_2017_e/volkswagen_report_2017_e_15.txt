The diesel crisis was made public on September 18, 2015 – a date 
etched in the Group’s collective memory. Key events are shown in the 
timeline below. 
The diesel issue prompted a process by which we strengthened our 
corporate culture, particularly in the areas of compliance and inter-
nal control mechanisms. This development led to the initiation of 
programs and projects designed to intensify Volkswagen’s collective 
awareness of integrity.  
We honed our internal control systems for the product development 
process and vehicle testing, overhauled our Code of Conduct and the 
whistleblower system, and increased the frequency of the training 
courses provided to staff on these topics. 
The combination of integrity, compliance and culture is an important 
and indispensable part of the transformation process we are under-
going. We are renewing ourselves from the inside out and are evolving 
on a daily basis to merit our most important asset – the trust of our 
customers and shareholders.  
Our exhaustive investigation continues; it also touches on a wide 
range of legal issues. Further information on this complex subject 
area can be found in the Management Report in our Annual Report 
2017. A critical analysis also appears in our sustainability magazine, 
Shift 2017.
