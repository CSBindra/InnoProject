The most powerful weapon against 
counterfeiting today is data and 
analytics, and the only way we  
can win this war is to unite. With

global fight against counterfeits.

partner with brands to understand their 
specific product characteristics and, using 
our sophisticated algorithms and robust  
data processing and analytics technology,  
we detect, identify, block and remove 
suspicious product listings from our 
platform and	penalize	bad	actors.
In 2017, Alibaba’s real-time information 
scanning capabilities enabled the company  
to proactively remove vastly more listings 
than those flagged by rights holders. All  
but a few of these listings were eliminated 
before a single sale took place.
