Our Vision by 2036
The Role of Mission and Vision
Typical public corporations 
think of “corporate 
governance” as a set of 
policies, rules, processes  
and compliance procedures. 
The presumption is that  
the profit motive inherently 
encourages risk taking by 
managers that must be 
tempered by checks and 
balances that reflect ethical 
considerations. 
We do not view “growth” 
versus “governance” as a 
zero-sum game. In fact, quite 
the opposite. We believe a 
company must be mission-
driven in order to achieve 
sustainability.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY DEFINES 
OUR MISSION AND VISION 
The belief in our mission – to make it easy to 
do business anywhere – is the foundational 
logic underlying our business decisions. We 
believe that we do not create value if we do 
not solve the problems of society, and if we 
do not create value for our customers, then 
the company will not be able to generate any 
revenue, much less profits, from customers. 
We have stated publicly that we want Alibaba 
to last – “at least 102 years” which would span 
three centuries from our founding in 1999. 
Our vision – to serve 2 billion consumers 
globally and help create 100 million jobs  
by supporting 10 million businesses to 
operate profitably by year 2036 – helps  
us set long-term strategy and goals that  
are consistent with our values. This vision 
focuses our priorities on consumer trust, 
small business and job creation.
We ask that everyone joining our company 
commit to our mission and vision. If we 
weren’t guided by a common mission, then 
Alibaba would be a mere investment holding 
company with disparate businesses. With  
the collective pursuit of a clear vision, our 
various businesses will work together to 
generate synergies that drive long-term 
sustainable growth. 
Because we believe Alibaba’s business  
should be guided and driven by our mission 
and vision, socially responsible elements –  
i.e., solving customer problems, earning 
consumer trust, helping small businesses  
and creating jobs – are embedded in our 
business model.
