Alibaba’s sustainability priorities
A Focus on What Matters Most: 
Our ESG Priorities
For this first ESG report, we undertook  
a rigorous materiality assessment that 
included input from internal and external 
stakeholders. Over the past year, we 
surveyed about 50 institutional shareholders 
representing around US$65 billion of  
our market capitalization as well as input  
from, among others, our customers and 
employees. Their input and this process  
led us to identify the seven issues (in box to 
right) as most critical to the sustainability of  
our business.
