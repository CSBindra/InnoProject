Environment
A clean environment is the earth’s scarce resource. Even  
though we are not an industrial manufacturing company with  
a significant environmental footprint, we recognize that every 
company, no matter what business it is in, has a responsibility 
to minimize its environmental impact. 
We are driving environmental sustainability by innovating in 
the highest	impact	areas	of	our	business.	All	the	initiatives	we	
undertake in environmental sustainability are fundamentally 
connected to our core business practices and help inform our 
long-term strategies to make sure our businesses and systems 
adapt to the future.
