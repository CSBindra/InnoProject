Intellectual Property  
Rights Protection 
The	protection	of	intellectual	property	rights	(IPR)	 
is core to the operation of a healthy marketplace.  
Trust is essential for the health and sustainability of 
Alibaba’s business, and consumers and merchants 
place tremendous trust in our online marketplaces. 
We have	established	an	industry-leading	IPR	operation	
that ensures we are a source of branded, authorized 
goods, and that strongly deters the sale of illicit or 
unauthorized goods, in order to protect the interests 
of rights holders, brands and consumers.
