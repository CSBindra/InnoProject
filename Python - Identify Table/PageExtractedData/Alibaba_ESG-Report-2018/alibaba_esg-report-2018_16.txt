1   We encourage shareholders to engage with us and make  
their views known to the board or to the independent 
directors as a group, especially at the time of our annual 
general meeting and by writing to our Company Secretary.
 
2   Our independent directors have the chance to meet  
in executive session with no management members  
present at all regularly scheduled board meetings.
3   Our Integrity Compliance Department has the power  
to conduct investigations of any suspected non-compliance 
with the law or our Code of Ethics, and has authority  
over all directors, officers and employees. We conduct 
mandatory annual training to help prevent violations, and  
we are transparent about violations that have occurred.
