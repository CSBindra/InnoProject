• We encourage each employee to  
dedicate three hours per year to social 
impact causes, and we motivate our 
employees to do so by asking them to 
reflect on what it means to live a purposeful 
life. Since the establishment of the “3 hours” 
program in 2015, Alibaba employees have 
accumulated a total of 482,601 hours for 
social services. 
• Through our platforms, we supported  
over 1.7 million merchants and over  
360 million users to donate to domestic  
and international charitable projects.  
We also enabled charitable organizations  
to raise approximately US$50 million  
in donations in fiscal year 2018, which 
benefited approximately 3.3 million 
disadvantaged individuals.
