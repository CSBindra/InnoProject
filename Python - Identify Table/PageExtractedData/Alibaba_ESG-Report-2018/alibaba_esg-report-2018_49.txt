Concluding thoughts
While we have regularly 
communicated our social 
impact strategy to domestic 
stakeholders in China, 
creating our first ESG  
report for the international 
investment community is  
an important milestone for 
our company. We will make 
periodic updates to our  
ESG strategy and activities  
in the future.
In the process of creating this ESG report, 
we focused	on	the	risks	and	opportunities	
that are most critical to our long-term 
sustainability as a business, and to our 
ambitions for the Alibaba Digital Economy. 
The process has deepened our resolve to 
keep	corporate	governance,	IPR	protection,	
cybersecurity, data protection, human 
capital, social contribution, and the 
environment top of our agenda. We know 
these issues are important to our stakeholders 
who not only judge us based on financial 
performance but also whether we are 
responsible actors in the global community. 
We hope that this ESG report has given you  
a fresh understanding of the integrated and 
comprehensive nature of ESG issues in our 
culture and business model. We are better 
prepared than ever for a dialogue about 
these issues. We welcome your feedback  
at BABAESG@alibaba-inc.com.
