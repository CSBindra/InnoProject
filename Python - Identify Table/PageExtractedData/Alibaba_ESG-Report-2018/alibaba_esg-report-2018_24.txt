Mars Inc.
In July 2017, after investigating and collecting 
evidence in cooperation with Mars Inc.  
(a global producer of confectionary, pet food, 
and other food products), Alibaba won a 
landmark civil lawsuit in China against a 
seller infringing upon Mars Inc.’s products.  
A Shanghai court found the vendor guilty 
and	ordered	the	defendant	to pay	damages.	
The	case	is	believed	to	be	the first	of	its	kind	
in China, where an e-commerce platform has 
successfully sought compensation  
from one of its online retailers. 
We adopt a zero-tolerance attitude toward 
counterfeiting, and firmly preserve the  
rights and interests of consumers, as well  
as brand’s reputation. Mars is determined  
to work with Alibaba and other parties to  
keep the market order, and build a healthy  
and lively market environment with all efforts. 
We look forward to continuing to working 
with Alibaba and others to dismantle the 
supply chain of counterfeit goods, and to  
create an environment where counterfeiters 
can no longer hide.

In January 2017, Alibaba Group sued two 
vendors selling fake Swarovski watches via 
Taobao. This was the first-ever instance  
of an e-commerce platform taking  
a	counterfeiter	to court	in	China,	sending	 
a	strong	warning	to illegal	vendors	and	
demonstrating our determination to fight 
fake	products.	The international	brand	
Swarovski	said	in	a statement	that	it	is	
committed to protecting its brand and 
consumers from fraudulent selling activity, 
and it lauded Alibaba’s efforts to protect 
brands and its platforms’ integrity.
