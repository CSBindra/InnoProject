Environment continued
We run an e-commerce business  
where	tens of	millions	of	packages	are	
generated	for delivery	on	our	shopping	
platforms. Therefore, we are mindful of  
the	environmental	effect	of paper	and	 
plastic	packaging	as	well	as	the carbon	
footprint	of	transport	systems	in logistics.	
We provide daily services to hundreds 
of millions	of	consumers,	mostly	through	
our mobile	app	platforms.	Thus,	we	 
believe that we have a responsibility to  
bring environmental awareness to our 
customers through our vast reach.
INVESTING IN ENERGY-EFFICIENT 
DATA CENTERS AND SERVERS 
To reduce our carbon footprint and  
conserve energy, we focus on making 
pioneering changes to our infrastructure and 
buildings. We have been focusing on making 
our data centers more environmentally-
friendly by switching to cooling and water-
efficient systems supported by intelligent 
management technology and the use of 
renewable energy. 
Qiandao Lake  
Data Center
The Qiandao Lake Data Center adopts  
a state-of-the-art deep lake water cooling 
system which saves 300 million kWh of 
electricity and reduces CO2 emissions  
by 300,000 tons per year compared to 
other conventional data centers. The 
technology lowers its annual average 
Power	Usage	Effectiveness	(PUE)	to	as	 
low as 1.17, considerably lower than many 
leading Chinese data center companies. 
The system also reduces the annual 
average Water Usage Efficiency (WUE) to 
reach 0.197, which is also below China’s  
industry average.
Zhangbei  
Data Center
Located in Hebei province, in a naturally 
cool region with great access to wind 
power, the Zhangbei Data Center is 
powered 100% by renewable energy 
including solar and wind. This increases 
the data center’s energy efficiency by 
more than 4% while reducing construction 
and maintenance costs. The technology 
reduces the temperature of its servers, 
which	keeps	its	average	PUE	at	only	1.25	
and reduces the energy consumption 
typically used for cooling by 59%.

One of the most visible 
environmental effects of 
technology companies is the 
power consumption of their 
hardware infrastructure. 
Because we have a substantial 
cloud computing service 
business, we are taking on  
the power consumption of 
other enterprises as well as 
our own. We employ energy-
efficient technology and 
methods in our data centers, 
with a focus on minimizing 
our energy consumption.
