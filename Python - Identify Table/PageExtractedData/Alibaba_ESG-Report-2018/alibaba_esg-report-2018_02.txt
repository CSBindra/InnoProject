We have always felt a responsibility to help 
solve problems in society, because that is 
implied in our mission – “to make it easy  
to do business anywhere” – and we must 
consider how we will continue to manage 
risks and opportunities, including those 
associated with environmental, social  
and governance (ESG) factors.
