Cybersecurity continued
2017 11.11 Global 
Shopping Festival, 
a real testimony to 
our security capability 
During the 2017 11.11 Global Shopping 
Festival, the total amount of paid 
transactions was RMB168.2 billion 
(US$25.3 billion)	with	90%	of	the	
transactions executed via mobile devices. 
The Shopping Festival marked the biggest 
online shopping day in the world and was 
the most important marketing, promotion 
and sale event of the year for participating 
merchants – the smooth working of the 
transaction platform was mission-critical  
for our customers. 
In order to protect consumers and 
merchants from cyber-attacks and 
fraudulent transactions, our cybersecurity 
team put in place robust security measures 
to	filter	out	malicious	activities	and	IP	
addresses to ensure transaction validity. 
On that	day,	the	systems	of	Alibaba	and	our	
affiliate Ant Financial successfully processed 
peak orders of 325,000 per second, and 
256,000 peak payment transactions per 
second, and our logistics subsidiary Cainiao 
managed 812 million total delivery orders. 
Case 
studyOperating such a massive e-commerce platform, 
how do we guard against risks like malicious 
attacks, hackers, and fraud? Of course, we 
cannot take a case-by-case approach. We have 
to aggregate large numbers of logins or events 
to monitor security. We are continuously training 
our systems on the huge volumes of data we 
handle, and the system is becoming increasingly 
intelligent. We are the world-leading use case for 
artificial intelligence – and that is our advantage.
