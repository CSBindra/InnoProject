 
Data Protection
We put our users first in all aspects of our business, 
including data protection. Earning and keeping users’ 
trust is a key factor in the sustainability of our business. 
One way we do that is by clearly explaining to users in 
plain and simple language how their data is collected 
and used, as well as how to amend settings or opt out. 
We also employ rigorous internal control procedures 
and the use of advanced technology to ensure that 
data is protected.
