studyFOSTERING ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Following our mission, we aim to make it easy 
for entrepreneurs to create start-ups, including 
access to Alibaba Cloud Computing services to 
reduce IT and operational costs and providing 
start-up financing. Through our Rural Taobao 
program, we work with county and village-level 
communities to facilitate young people starting 
their own businesses selling products on our 
Taobao e-commerce platform.
We also devote our resources to supporting 
entrepreneurship through several not-for-
profit programs through the company as well 
as through personal financial commitments  
by	members	of	the	Alibaba	Partnership.

initiative with	a	HK$1	billion	fund	in	Hong	Kong

facilitate start-ups that receive funding to develop 
their business by leveraging the Alibaba Digital 
Economy, including our e-commerce marketplaces
