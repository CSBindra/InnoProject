 
Human Capital
As of June 30, 2018, we had 86,833 employees. 
Recognizing that the technology industry in which we 
operate is a highly competitive market for talent, our 
ability to recruit, retain, train and reward a talented 
and diverse	workforce	is	critical	to	our	long-term	
business success. While we remain competitive in 
compensating our employees, we believe that people 
join our company because we offer a clear mission and 
vision, and we provide not only career development 
opportunities, but also the opportunity to solve  
world-class problems at the scale of the Alibaba 
Digital Economy.
