Our MissionAlibaba is an institution of public trust. The 
Alibaba Digital Economy spans a vast scale  
of business operations with constituencies 
that include consumers, merchants, 
producers, creators, service providers, 
business partners, regulators, employees 
and of course our shareholders. With the 
mission “to make it easy to do business 
anywhere,” these stakeholders rely on us  
to solve many of their business problems.  
We believe that solving people’s problems 
and doing so ethically is the way to create 
value for society, and hence derive value  
for	our	company	and shareholders.	
Sustainability: 
At the Core of What We Do 
We believe public trust is earned by 
demonstrating that everything we do 
is sustainable. As a corporation with 
shareholders who expect us to make  
a profit, Alibaba defines “sustainability”  
as focusing on long-term value creation  
that drives sustainable profits. The pursuit  
of	sustainability	requires	that	we	do	the	 
right thing when our business impacts the 
environment and society, and we need a 
system of governance to ensure that we 
are always	choosing	the	right	ethical	path.	
This report is about how we address these 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) considerations,	putting	customers	
and employees	first	and	championing	
small businesses.
