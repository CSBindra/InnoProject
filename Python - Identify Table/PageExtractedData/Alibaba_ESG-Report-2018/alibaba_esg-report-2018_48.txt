Case 
study
Through the Alipay mobile payment app 
operated by our affiliate Ant Financial, users 
can collect “green energy points” through 
low-carbon options in their daily lives such  
as using e-payments instead of paper 
invoices and choosing public transportation, 
biking or walking instead of driving to reduce 
vehicle emissions. These “green energy 
power points” can be donated by users 
toward planting of trees in Northwest China. 
Users can track the progress real-time using 
their apps and share their progress via social 
media. Tapping into our digital platforms,  
we have created social games and features 
around the consciousness of carbon 
awareness for users, making tracking, 
sharing and contributing to a low-carbon 
lifestyle a part of people’s daily lives. As  
of May 2018, 55 million trees have been 
planted on behalf of Ant Financial’s users 
while 350 million users participated.
