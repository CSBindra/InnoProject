UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS 
SUPPORTING LAW 
ENFORCEMENT
Our online portal and our technology  
tools both generate leads, complaints and 
data	evidence	about	IP	infringers’	actions.	
Based on the information we collect and  
our ongoing engagement with brands,  
we approach and assist law enforcement 
officials in offline criminal and civil 
investigations. 
In 2017, Alibaba supported local police in 
23 provinces	and	cities	throughout	China	
in their	efforts	to	crack	down	on	the	sale	
of counterfeit	or	otherwise	inferior	quality	
goods, leading to the arrest of more than 
1,600 suspects and the closure of more 
than 1,300	facilities.
WINNING LAWSUITS AND 
TAKING BAD ACTORS TO COURT
In conjunction with the public appeal for 
stricter	enforcement	of	IP	laws	in	China,	
Alibaba was the first platform operator 
in China	to	bring	civil	lawsuits	against	
merchants who misuse its services for 
the sale	of	counterfeit	goods.
