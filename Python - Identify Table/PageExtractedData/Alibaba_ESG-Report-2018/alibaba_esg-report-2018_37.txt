Human Capital continued
Employees are encouraged to use “AliWay,” 
our online intranet, to freely voice their 
opinions online. Aliway includes an open 
forum for discussion and debate about 
any subject,	including	strategy,	products,	
company policies and working environment. 
Posts	in	this	forum	are	not	pre-screened	or	
censored. To encourage responsibility for 
one’s opinions, the posts are made on a 
real-name basis, but we make it clear that 
this would not lead to any retribution.
In addition, members of senior management 
maintain an “open” email box for the purpose 
of receiving direct, private feedback from 
employees. The “open” email provides a 
channel through which senior management 
can learn of issues “from the front lines.” 
TRAINING
We prioritize continuous learning through a 
comprehensive training system at all levels. 
Moreover, we encourage top performing 
employees within Alibaba to work overseas 
and encourage international staff to work in 
China. For senior and mid-level management, 
we place heads of business units and rising 
stars into small training groups and offer 
them modules on our corporate culture  
and strategy. Our most senior executives, 
including our chairman and CEO, participate 
in the teaching of these training groups. 
At the end of 2017, we conducted over  
2,500 training sessions on 4,000 topics  
for tens of thousands of our employees 
across Alibaba. Examples include sessions 
on Alibaba culture, people management, 
strategic thinking, product knowledge,  
data handling, and international business 
development.
