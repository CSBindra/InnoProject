O?ce waste not recycled 
In 2012, we set ourselves 10 strategic 
targets to reduce the environmental  
and ethical impacts of our operations by 
2020. Most of these are either completed, 
resulting in us having stretched some of 
these targets, or are on track to complete. 
We are experiencing challenges on our 
recycling goal and some of our stretched 
targets, as detailed below. 
The targets include strategic goals to 
reduce our carbon emissions, energy, 
waste, water and paper. We also set 
targets to increase recycling, procure 
electricity from renewable sources and 
commission buildings to the highest 
sustainability standards. In addition,  
we are working to enable sustainability 
education for our people, engage with  
our supply chains and fund pilot projects. 
Achieving our operational goals
Sustainable operations  
We reached three of our targets ahead  
of schedule, and in 2017 made our  
waste and paper reduction targets more 
ambitious, and committed to procuring 
electricity from 100% renewable sources 
by 2030. 
To see progress against all our goals, visit 
www.hsbc.com/our-approach/building-a-
sustainable-future/sustainable-operations. 
The strategic goals are governed by  
the Group Chief Operating Officer 
Sustainability Committee, which meets 
quarterly. Each of the goals is ‘owned’ by 
an executive sponsor who is responsible 
for the target being achieved. In seeking 
to reach our goals, we collaborate closely 
with our strategic suppliers and our 
employees to encourage positive actions. 
Reducing carbon emissions
We continue to reduce our carbon emissions by cutting our 
energy consumption, being more efficient in our buildings, 
working with our strategic partners and focusing on our 
renewable procurement strategy. Since 2011, our carbon 
emissions have fallen by 30% per FTE. In 2018, our total CO2 
emissions were 559,000 tonnes.1

International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 ‘Assurance 
engagements on greenhouse gas statements’, issued by the International 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This can be found on our website

Our people want to make a difference in 
their communities and at work, and we 
will continue to partner with them to  
focus on our waste and recycling goals. 
We are proud to have surpassed our 
green buildings goal of constructing  
50 buildings to the highest sustainability 
standards. In 2018, we opened our  
new HSBC UK headquarters, which  
was built to a Leadership in Energy  
and Environmental Design (‘LEED’)  
Gold standard, making it the first  
building in Birmingham to be constructed 
to this standard. The LEED certification  
is a globally recognised symbol of 
sustainability achievement. In 2019, we 
are opening our new UAE headquarters 
with a LEED Gold standard and will intend 
to continue to incorporate sustainability 
standards in new buildings.
