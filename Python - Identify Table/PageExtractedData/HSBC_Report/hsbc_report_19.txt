When things go wrong 
Encouraging our people to record  
all instances of complaints or negative 
feedback is essential to ensure we identify 
and take action on customer concerns 
and improve the services we provide.  
To support this, we are refreshing  
training modules to emphasise the 
positive benefits of effective complaint 
handling and including a requirement  
to accurately record complaints in 
individuals’ objectives.
In 2018, we received 550 complaints,  
a decrease of 5% on 2017. The significant 
majority (77%) related to service and 
administration issues, which include 
investment reporting, delay or failure  
to process customer instructions, 
dissatisfaction with postal or online 
services, and record updating. We 
recognise our investment reporting 
capabilities require improvement and  
we plan to make a number of changes  
in 2019. We are striving to reduce the

1.  A complaint is defined as any oral or written 
expression of dissatisfaction, whether justified or 
not, from, or on behalf of, a person about the 
provision of, or failure to provide, a financial 
service or a complaint determination.
potential for human error and frustration 
that can result from additional requests  
for updated personal and business 
information.
Product and performance issues were 
responsible for 9% of complaints. These 
doubled compared with 2017 and can be 
sensitive to the performance of individual 
funds and investments compared with 
market benchmarks. The third most 
common complaint related to pricing 
(8%). A common root cause was the 
challenge of applying certain customers’ 
special pricing terms consistently, and 
steps are being taken to reduce the 
scope for human error where possible.
In 2018, we resolved 504 complaints of 
which 219 were upheld. 
 
Spotlight: Conduct
One of our primary goals is to achieve  
fair conduct outcomes. Senior leaders  
set the tone and recently supported a 
series of workshops for colleagues in  
our European booking centres. These 
included real conduct case studies for 
senior management and supervisors  
to discuss with their teams, and will 
continue in 2019 to maintain the  
current level of focus.
Strengthening our controls 
Since 2015, we have published  
a number of conduct-related policies, 
including those addressing conflicts of 
interest, best execution, sales suitability, 
pricing, product governance, the 
supervisory framework and potentially 
vulnerable customers.
We continue to focus on ensuring these 
are embedded and applied consistently 
across the business. Ongoing work to 
strengthen controls includes:
 –Sales suitability: We established sales 
quality assurance (‘SQA’) teams in  
2017, enabling us to focus on improving 
the quality and consistency of our 
investment advice. In 2018, more than 
3,200 trades were sample tested, 93% 
of which provided advice in line with 
our standards, with identified issues 
resulting in appropriate remedial action 
including customer contact where 
necessary. The SQA teams also perform 
thematic reviews, focusing on high risk 
scenarios. Where deviations from the 
standards or issues are identified, they 
are escalated and corrective action is 
taken, where required. 
 –Supervisory framework: We defined a 
new framework in 2018, establishing 
clear standards and guidelines for 
individuals with responsibility for 
supervising customer-facing employees. 
 –Product governance and pricing: We 
strengthened our product governance 
in 2018 with increased global oversight. 
Our product pricing principles, set by a 
global pricing policy and fair value 
exchange criteria for specific asset 
classes, are being embedded in all 
booking centres. 
Training our people  
for fair outcomes
Through the ongoing deployment of 
role-based learning, all customer-facing 
teams completed conduct training as 
required by their role in 2018. Building  
on this, we developed specific learning 
programmes for people managers  
and supervisors. This training develops 
capabilities to supervise, coach and 
develop relationship managers, 
investment counsellors and customer 
service executives within GPB. 
 For further information on our approach to conduct 
and the steps we have taken, see pages 37 to 39.
