How we listen to our customers
the same levels or improved compared  
with last year. We have focused on 
improving our customer service training and 
providing simpler processes with enhanced 
technology. We also launched our Universal 
Banker programme in five markets,  
which helps train our people to be digitally 
equipped, and empowers them to resolve 
more queries themselves. Over 4,000 
employees are now Universal Bankers.  
Less positively, the satisfaction score of  
our US contact centres fell and overall 
complaints rose, driven by a significant 
overhaul of the banking platform, which 
led to increased call volumes and customer 
wait times. We addressed this through 
increasing headcount and expanding our 
chatbot capabilities.
We listen to our customers in a number  
of different ways, including through our 
interactions with them, surveys, social 
media and from their complaints. We use 
these insights to improve our services.  
Customer recommendation 
In 2018, we surveyed more than two million 
customers on their likelihood to recommend 
HSBC to others and their satisfaction  
with our services. We have made some 
progress, with recommendation scores 
improving in the majority of markets. More 
customers recommended us for being 
easily accessible, offering good digital 
services, and our overall customer service. 
However, our savings accounts remain an 
area of dissatisfaction, with more customers 
telling us they are seeking competitive rates 
and charges. In the UK, the First Direct 
brand ranked first for mobile banking 
services and second overall in the 
Competition and Markets Authority 
rankings in 2018, where banks were scored 
by customers on the quality of service.
In 2018, we changed the way we  
report customer recommendation by 
broadening the range of customers we 
survey, and by looking at the full range of 
scores provided. We believe this provides  
a more representative and complete 
perspective on the customer service  
we offer relative to the market. 
Customer satisfaction 
Customer satisfaction in our online banking 
services rose in some of our key markets in 
2018, following significant declines in the 
previous year. The decline in satisfaction in 
2017 came after the launch of a new online 
banking system and enhanced security 
features. The new platform should help 
enable us to roll out new digital services at 
a faster pace while keeping our customers 
safe. However, we saw a drop in customer 
satisfaction as customers learned how to 
use the new service. By listening to our 
customers, we improved the way we 
communicated changes and fixed a 
number of the issues that were causing  
the most frustration, such as login and 
payments. Four out of the five most

1.  Customer satisfaction is calculated by percentage of customers providing an 8 or above on a scale  
from 0 to 10. For contact centre scores, the exceptions are the US, Canada and Singapore in 2017, and 
Singapore in 2018, where the score shows the percentage of customers rating 4 or above out of 5.
2.  The index uses the 0–10 rating scale for the customer recommendation question to create a 100 point index. 
This survey is run by an independent and global market research agency. Following the reporting change, 
2018 and 2017 figures have been restated to focus on the full range of scores provided by customers.
affected markets in 2018, the UK, Canada, 
US and China, experienced recoveries  
in customer satisfaction. However, in  
Hong Kong, our customers were more 
dissatisfied by our browser-based banking 
experience. We have responded with new 
initiatives to improve the experience such 
as adding real-time customer assistance 
capabilities, and plan to continue 
enhancements to our capabilities. In 2018, 
we focused our efforts on upgrading our 
mobile banking experience where we have 
seen the highest growth in customer
