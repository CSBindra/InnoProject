Well-being and developing 
our people  
Employee well-being
A healthy and happy workforce  
is essential for a positive working 
environment. Our priorities for our 
people are mental health, flexible 
working and financial well-being. 
Mental health
We want HSBC to be an environment 
where people feel they can be open about 
their mental health and concerns. While 
we have taken action, we know there is 
more to do. 
In October 2018, we held over 75 events 
to support World Mental Health Day. 
This included a video interview between 
John Flint, our Group Chief Executive, 
and Brian Heyworth, our Global Head of 
Client Strategy, sharing their perspectives 
on mental health at HSBC. This has 
become one of the most viewed internal 
videos and helped open the conversation 
within HSBC.
We offer an employee assistance 
programme so our people have free 
access to external expert assistance and 
confidential advice when they require it, 
such as after suffering a bereavement or 
personal difficulty. We advertise these 
third-party programmes locally so our 
people have the available information  
to get the best support. 
We use our learning platform, HSBC 
University, to publish articles and 
resources relating to mental health  
from industry-leading bodies. 
In 2019, we will start to provide 
widespread mental health education  
and support to our people, starting with  
a programme of mental health education 
for all managers. Our focus will be on 
spotting the signs of mental ill-health, 
having open conversations and 
signposting the right support. This will  
be supported by local and Group-wide 
awareness campaigns, recognising that 
we all have a part to play to create a  
more open environment. 
Flexible working
Our 2017 global well-being survey 
confirmed that 49% of our people work 
flexibly, and those who do are more 
positive about their general well-being. 
We know this is an area where people 
want more support, so during 2018 we 
invested in technology and infrastructure. 
We expanded an OpenWork concept, 
which makes it easier for our people to 
work flexibly across 27 cities covering 
approximately 75,000 staff. This helped 
more of our people make positive choices 
that meet their needs both inside and 
outside of work. 
One of our HSBC Communities, Flex, 
which supports flexible working, has  
run global events on topics such as job 
sharing. These included an event on 
International Men’s Day, which focused 
on male employees and the mental health 
benefits of flexible working. Our priority 
for 2019 is to implement consistent 
flexible working principles across HSBC.
Financial well-being
In 2018, we re-launched our employee 
assistance programmes, to include 
financial support. In addition, multiple 
countries have run financial capability 
events, including Mexico, UAE and the UK.
In 2019, we are enhancing the content and 
roll-out of our events and education as we 
recognise there is further action needed. 
 For more information on how we are working to 
increase financial capability, see pages 11 and 34. 
Learning and development
Talent development 
We recognise we must invest in our 
people to continue to thrive. 
The International Manager Programme is 
one of our flagship talent programmes. 
With approximately 300 international 
managers currently deployed across  
46 countries, the programme provides 
resourcing flexibility and helps us develop 
a strong pipeline of home-grown future 
leaders for our most critical positions. 
International mobility is key to future 
success. We offer international 
secondments and transfers to our wider 
employee base, which enhances career 
development opportunities, and helps to 
attract, develop and motivate our people 
who demonstrate high potential.
Expanding HSBC University 
The opportunity to develop is one of  
the most important factors affecting  
how people feel about HSBC. We 
celebrated the first anniversary of our 
home of learning, HSBC University,  
in November 2018. Thousands of 
resources are available through this 
platform, which receives more than 
52,000 visits per month. 
HSBC University strengthens how  
we learn and lead through new 
programmes, resources and premises. 
We have launched HSBC University 
regional hubs at our offices in Dubai  
and the HSBC UK headquarters in 
Birmingham, providing opportunities  
for our colleagues, customers and 
community groups to come together  
to learn, develop and connect.
We have expanded our management  
and leadership development with new 
programmes, including Leading with 
Impact for senior leaders, and Leading 
Myself for those without a team. We have 
developed our Essentials programme to 
support people managers and strengthen 
their coaching and hiring skills. In 2018, 
600 leaders completed the Leaders as 
Teachers programme and put their skills 
into practice by supporting colleagues’ 
training through business programmes, 
Leadership Essentials and the Accelerated 
Development Programme.
We are committed to helping our  
people prepare for the future of work.  
We launched digital skills training, and  
our Leading Myself programme explored 
areas including personal resilience, 
collaboration and communicating with 
impact. This is a continued area of focus  
as there is more to do. 
During 2018, we formed partnerships with 
external providers, including LinkedIn 
Learning and Coursera, and introduced 
learning modules to raise awareness of 
our sustainability challenges. 
 For further details on how we are building 
future skills, see page 34.
