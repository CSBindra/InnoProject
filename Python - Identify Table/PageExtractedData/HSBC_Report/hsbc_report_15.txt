When things go wrong
We support our people to help make  
sure they handle customer complaints 
effectively, with a training module 
available to all relevant employees.  
A new global complaints management 
procedure was delivered in the first 
quarter of 2019 to help make sure we 
continue to manage complaints in an 
equitable and timely way, in an effort  
to provide effective and fair outcomes  
for our customers.
In 2018, we resolved a total of 77,892 
corporate customer complaints, which 
was a 35% year-on-year increase, with 
81% coming from customers in the UK, 
3% in France and 2% in the US. 
We have stepped up our financial crime 
prevention procedures due to increased 
scrutiny in this area, but as a result this 
has led to increased complaints from  
our customers, representing more than  
a quarter (27%) of total complaints. 
Dissatisfaction was often due to requests 
for additional personal and business 
information to help us guard against  
fraud and money laundering. Without 
those details, services were sometimes 
restricted and, in certain circumstances, 
accounts were closed. After reviewing 
customer communications, we have 
improved the content and layout of letters, 
making the process clearer and simpler.
Operational complaints were the  
second highest in volume (25% of total 
complaints), reflecting the most frequent 
customer transactions. Improvements in 
the payment processes and the way  
we handle queries reduced complaints 
significantly in Asia-Pacific. We are keen 
to learn from these events to improve 
customer experience in other markets.
Account opening complaints reflected  
the third largest in volume (7% of total 
complaints). In the UK, challenges with  
the introduction of a new system led to

We regularly review a list of all products 
sold to our corporate customers so they 
remain appropriate and relevant to  
our customers. To help make sure all  
our products meet customer needs,  
we have a rigorous governance and  
approval process for any new product  
or significant changes to existing ones. 
We operate sales outcome testing  
in 12 key markets designed to ensure 
customers have understood the features 
of their chosen products, such as pricing, 
mechanics, risk and benefits. In 2018,  
we identified 132 issues through the 
CMB outcome testing programme, such 
as documentation, sales process, and 
pricing issues. Actions are underway to 
address these issues.
We recognise it is important to provide 
our products at a fair price and in a 
transparent way. Since late 2017, an 
executive pricing steering committee  
has been improving our existing pricing 
framework to help make sure we  
price products and services fairly, 
communicate transparently, and have 
robust controls in place. Following our 
focused efforts, complaints around fees 
and charges have fallen by 20% over  
the last two years.
We have put a strong emphasis on 
communicating to our people on how  
we should behave. We broadcast videos 
of senior leaders speaking about what 
conduct means to them and why it is 
important. We feature examples of 
employees making the right decisions  
in the interests of customers in global 
employee communications. Countries, 
regions and global operations all held 
conduct-themed workshops, informal 
Exchange sessions and town halls.  
Spotlight: Conduct
This has resulted in a significant input  
of ideas and concerns that have allowed 
our leaders to shape their own conduct 
agendas and communications. For 
further details of our Exchange forums, 
see the Employees section on page 22. 
The scorecards for front-line employees 
are now balanced with a maximum  
of 50% being related to performance.  
We are increasingly seeing instances of 
role model behaviours driving upward 
adjustments in variable pay from 1%  
in 2015 to 8% in 2017.
Fraud is a growing problem and we strive 
to protect our customers from financial 
crime. In Mexico, we introduced training 
for our relationship managers focused  
on business email compromise and 
malware fraud so they can pass on this 
knowledge to customers and take the 
right action if a customer is affected.
an increase in complaints. In France,  
rapid business growth during early 2018 
resulted in higher than expected account 
opening requests, increasing the time 
taken to open accounts. Additional 
resources were employed and changes 
implemented to streamline the process, 
resulting in a reduction in complaints later 
in the year.
1.  Volumes for the UK are received complaints from eligible complainants to align with the current FCA 
reporting. Volumes of complaints for the rest of the markets are based on resolved complaints.
