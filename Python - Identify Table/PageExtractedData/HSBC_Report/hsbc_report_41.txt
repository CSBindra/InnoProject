and could not be resolved. GPB has  
also amended its standard terms and 
conditions, which now require customers 
to affirm that they are in compliance with 
their tax obligations, allow the bank to 
refuse requests for cash withdrawals and 
place strict controls on withdrawals over 
$10,000. Furthermore, GPB discontinued 
its ‘hold mail’ service and has withdrawn 
from markets where it has been unable 
to conduct due diligence to a satisfactory 
standard on its customers.
As a result of these reforms, the number 
of accounts and total customer assets  
of GPB have been significantly reduced 
by this intensive de-risking exercise, 
where we have put compliance and  
tax transparency ahead of profitability. 
Where we used to offer banking services 
to customers in more than 140 countries, 
GPB now focuses on 34 strategic 
markets, with customer assets actively 
managed down by $140bn between 
2013 and 2018.
While GPB has resolved a number  
of legacy issues relating to the  
past, investigations into former  
practices are ongoing in a number  
of countries at the time of publication.  
In addition, we acknowledge that  
GPB’s role in providing financial  
services to high-profile individuals may 
sometimes result in GPB receiving  
undue media attention.

Banking customers, see pages 16 and 17.
Foreign exchange conduct
Prior to 2013, our foreign exchange (‘FX’) 
business lacked adequate governance, 
oversight and risk management in order 
to ensure compliance with safe and 
sound banking practices and applicable 
internal policies. As a result, we failed to 
detect and address unsafe and unsound 
conduct by certain of our FX traders, 
which included the misuse of confidential 
inside information to conduct FX trades, 
possible agreements with traders of 
other institutions to coordinate FX trading 
and disclosure of confidential information 
to traders of other institutions. 
In November 2014, HSBC agreed to 
regulatory settlements with the FCA  
and the US Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission in connection with their 
respective investigations of HSBC’s 
trading and other conduct involving FX 
benchmark rates. In September 2017, 
HSBC entered into a consent order with 
the US Federal Reserve Board (‘FRB’)  
in connection with its investigation into 
HSBC’s FX activities. Under the terms  
of that order, HSBC agreed to undertake 
certain remedial steps and to pay a civil 
money penalty to the FRB. In January 
2018, HSBC Holdings plc entered into  
a three-year deferred prosecution 
agreement with the DoJ (‘FX DPA’), 
regarding fraudulent conduct in 
connection with two particular 
transactions in 2010 and 2011. 
Since the historical conduct described  
in these agreements, we have introduced 
a number of measures designed to make 
the control environment more robust  
and prevent these failings from recurring 
in the future. We have dedicated,  
and continue to dedicate, significant 
resources to strengthen our systems  
and controls. While the investigations 
focused specifically on our FX activity, 
they have also given us good reason  
to look again at other aspects of our 
conduct more broadly within the Global 
Banking and Markets (‘GB&M’) business. 
Improvements to our conduct agenda 
started more than four years ago and 
continue to this day. We are enhancing 
and accelerating progress made in 
strengthening and remediating our 
systems and controls and broader 
compliance culture through a newly 
established GB&M Conduct Committee, 
led by our GB&M Chief Executive Officer. 
Market experts are providing input.  
The agenda focuses on culture and 
behaviours; customers, including 
suitability, conflicts of interest, pricing 
and transparency; markets, covering 
market conduct, trade execution and 
competition; governance and controls; 
and strategy and business planning. 
Progress is being tracked and reported 
through our own governance channels, 
as well as being reported to the FRB,  
DoJ and our regulators in line with our 
agreements with them all.
Conduct is core to how we operate  
and manage our business. We have 
already implemented improvements  
to algorithmic trading to manage risk 
around benchmark orders, and updated 
our policies for sales, order handling, 
managing confidential customer 
information and conflicts of interest, 
pre-hedging and market abuse. In 2018, 
we introduced further improvements to 
the management of sensitive information 
through physical barriers, technology 
controls and procedures. We have also 
continued to invest in enhancing our 
voice, trade and electronic surveillance 
capabilities across the globe to improve 
the monitoring of telephone calls, instant 
messages and trades to spot potentially 
improper activity. Global and regional 
conduct governance forums have been 
created to provide supervision and 
oversight over the implementation and 
effectiveness of our conduct agenda. An 
extensive plan is in place, and we aim to 
deliver this as fast and efficiently as we 
can. Our success will determine how well 
we deliver the right outcomes for our 
customers and stakeholders, consistently 
and reliably, for many years to come.

Global Banking and Markets customers,
