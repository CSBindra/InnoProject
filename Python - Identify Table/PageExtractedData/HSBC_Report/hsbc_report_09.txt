Our relationship
Our purpose is to be where the growth is, connecting 
customers to opportunities. We help enable businesses  
to thrive and economies to prosper, helping people fulfil  
their hopes and dreams and realise their ambitions. 
We create value by providing the products and services  
our customers need, and aim to do so in a way that fits 
seamlessly into their lives. This helps us to build long-lasting 
relationships with our customers. We maintain trust by 
striving to protect our customers’ data and information,  
and delivering fair outcomes for them – and if things  
go wrong, we need to address complaints in a timely 
manner. Operating with high standards of conduct is  
central to our long-term success and underpins our  
ability to serve our customers.
In this section we report on our customers as four  
distinct groups: our retail customers; medium and large-
sized corporate customers; global and institutional 
customers; and high net worth customers. These groups  
 are serviced by our four global businesses respectively:
