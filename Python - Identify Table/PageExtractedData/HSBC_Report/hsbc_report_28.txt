Our relationship
Our actions have an impact on the 
communities where we do business 
and the wider environment. We want to 
ensure we are helping economies grow 
sustainably, and we choose to direct 
our resources, including time, people 
and capital, to helping the global 
transition to a low-carbon economy.
We have shown progress against our 
targets in sustainable finance, and 
have set out how we are partnering 
with our customers to assist with the 
transition to a low-carbon economy. 
We are also engaging with our 
customers on transition risk, and 
embedding climate risk within our  
own risk management practices.  
We understand that it is important  
to report disclosure on both climate-
related opportunities and risks to our 
stakeholders, and include our second 
disclosure under the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosure 
(‘TCFD’) in this section.
We recognise that technology is 
developing at a rapid pace in the 
communities where we operate,  
and that a range of new and different 
skills are now needed to succeed in  
the workplace. We continue to focus 
around employability and financial 
capability resulting in global 
programmes and activities that address 
this in our diverse global communities. 
We continue to prioritise providing  
a rich variety of volunteering 
opportunities for our employees  
globally and continue to invest in  
the communities we operate in. 
 
 Supporting sustainable growth 
We aim to grow our business in a sustainable way  
with a focus on moving to a low-carbon economy  
to protect our planet, recognising our duty to support  
the communities in which we operate.
