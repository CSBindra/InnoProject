The transition to a low-carbon economy 
will occur over a multi-year horizon and  
it will take time for sectors currently 
dependent on fossil fuels to adapt. While 
it is acknowledged there should be a 
significant and immediate reduction in 
the use of coal to generate power, other 
traditional sources of energy, such as oil 
and gas, have a longer term role during 
the transition. Developing countries may 
also need more time to adjust as they 
balance sometimes competing 
sustainable development goals.
In this context, we are working to  
further understand the specific risks  
and opportunities climate change 
presents to our customers, and we are 
developing our knowledge and capacity 
to support their transition towards a  
more sustainable future. We are doing  
this through our engagement in the 
Energy Transitions Commission,  
thought leadership articles published  
on the Centre of Sustainable Finance  
(www.sustainablefinance.hsbc.com),  
and other industry engagement.
In 2018, we developed a transition  
risk questionnaire with some of our 
customers to improve our understanding 
of their climate transition strategies.  
This is helping us to identify which 
customers need to adapt rapidly to 
climate-related risks, and spot potential 
business opportunities. In time, this 
information can be incorporated into an 
initial assessment of transition risk within 
our credit risk management processes. 
We plan to roll the questionnaire out 
more widely in 2019. We have also 
embedded climate risk more broadly  
in our risk management processes.  
More information can be found in  
the risk management section of  
our TCFD disclosure on page 30.
Another important element of our climate 
risk management is covered via our 
sustainability risk management strategy. 
Sustainability risk is broader than climate 
risk. We define it as the risk that financial 
services provided to customers by the 
Group indirectly result in unacceptable 
impacts on people or the environment. 
Group Sustainability Risk, which is part of 
the Global Risk function, is responsible for 
managing our sustainability risk policies 
(covering agricultural commodities, 
chemicals, defence, energy, forestry, 
mining and metals, UNESCO World 
Heritage sites, and Ramsar-designated 
wetlands) and our application of the 
Equator Principles. As with climate risk 
management, we seek to partner with  
our customers to improve their operating 
standards. For more information on  
how we manage sustainability risk, see 
www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-
responsibility/sustainability-risk.
Our energy policy
Our approach is to support our 
customers to transition to a low-carbon 
economy while limiting the financing of 
high-carbon intensity energy projects. In 
2018, we updated our energy policy and 
set out our position with respect to new 
project financing of coal-fired power, 
Our approach to climate risk management  
Engaging with our customers on palm oil
Palm oil is the world’s main vegetable oil. It requires less  
land per output than other vegetable oils, and its production 
can bring wide economic benefits. However, when produced 
unsustainably, palm oil can lead to deforestation, resulting  
in threats to endangered species, social conflict and  
climate change. 
We have worked closely with our customers to support 
certification through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm  
Oil (‘RSPO’), an independent organisation that sets standards 
of good practice against which companies are independently 
certified. Internally, we have progressively raised our own 
policy standards. In 2014, we decided we would only finance 
customers that were already partly certified under RSPO and 
aimed to complete certification by the end of 2018. Customers 
also need to provide evidence of independent verification 
under their commitments to ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, and 
No Exploitation’ (‘NDPE’). Our agricultural commodities policy 
is available online at www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-
responsibility/sustainability-risk.
A number of our customers have chosen to operate 
sustainably as a result of our engagement, including  
11 customers that have introduced NDPE policies  
following discussions with HSBC. At the end of 2018: 
 –We financed 22 customers engaged in palm oil  
production that have either met our policy or will do so 
shortly. Several customers are in the final stages of full 
certification, managing external delays and resource 
constraints to meet our specific requirements.
 –We have 31 customers who have operations in the palm  
oil sector, but where we do not finance this part of their 
business. We have engaged with those customers and 
many operate to or are working towards good practice.  
 –We have 19 customers that do not meet our policy,  
and we intend to discontinue the relationship when  
existing loans have been repaid.  
greenfield projects in the oil sands, 
offshore Arctic drilling and due diligence 
requirements.
Our energy policy is available online at 
www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-
responsibility/sustainability-risk.
HSBC’s exposure to coal mining
In 2016, we updated our mining and 
metals policy, so that we no longer 
finance new thermal coal mines or new 
customers dependent on thermal coal 
mining. We also committed to publicly 
report on our exposure to the coal mining 
sector. At 31 December 2018, our 
exposure to coal mining was $0.8bn, 
unchanged from a year earlier. This 
represents 4% of our total exposure to 
the mining and metals sector in 2018. 
We have adopted a new methodology  
for the identification of exposures to  
the metals and mining sector in order  
to align with our TCFD disclosure. The 
methodology is explained in footnote 37 
on page 67 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2018.
Equator Principles in 2018
Under the terms of the Equator Principles, 
we report annually on the transactions 
completed under the Principles. In 2018, 
we undertook 18 transactions under  
the Principles, compared with 20 in 2017. 
A detailed summary of our transactions  
and implementation can be found at 
www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-
responsibility/sustainability-risk/equator-
principles.
