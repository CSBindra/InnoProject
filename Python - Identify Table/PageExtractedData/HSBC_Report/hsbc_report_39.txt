Restoration of trust in our industry remains 
a significant challenge as past misdeeds 
continue to remain in the spotlight. But it  
is a challenge we must meet successfully. 
We owe this not just to our customers and 
to society at large, but to our employees to 
ensure they can be rightly proud of the 
organisation where they work. We aim to 
act with courageous integrity in all we do. 
This guiding principle means having the 
courage to make decisions based on doing 
the right thing for customers and never 
compromising our ethical standards  
or integrity.
We have also sought to learn from past 
mistakes, such as the following three 
examples, and we are seeking to develop 
and implement specific measures 
designed to prevent recurrence of similar 
events in the future.
Anti-money laundering  
and sanctions
Between the 1990s and 2010, as 
acknowledged by HSBC in various 
agreements with US and UK authorities  
in 2012, HSBC failed to implement 
appropriate anti-money laundering (‘AML’) 
and sanctions controls. These oversight 
and control failures resulted in HSBC 
allowing at least $881 million in drug 
proceeds to be laundered through  
HSBC into the US financial system and 
approximately $660 million in transactions 
involving sanctioned countries, such  
as Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Libya and Burma,  
to be processed, in violation of applicable 
US laws.
In December 2012, HSBC entered into 
resolutions with, among others, the US 
Department of Justice (‘DoJ’) and the UK 
Financial Services Authority (now the 
Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA), 
regarding these past AML and sanctions-
related failings. Under these agreements, 
which included a five-year deferred 
prosecution agreement with the DoJ  
(‘the AML DPA’), HSBC made payments 
totalling $1.9bn to US authorities and 
undertook various further obligations, 
including the retention of an independent 
compliance monitor. 
Restoring trust  
Over the past several years, we  
have radically restructured our global 
operations and significantly strengthened 
our ability to combat financial crime. 
We recognise that we have a responsibility 
to help protect the integrity of the global 
financial system. In order to fulfil that 
responsibility, we have made, and continue 
to make, significant investments in our 
ability to detect, deter and prevent financial 
crime. We have exited customers, 
products and countries where we deemed 
the financial crime risk too high to manage. 
We are also working with governments 
and other banks to advance our mutual 
interests in this area. These steps are 
enabling us to much more effectively 
reduce the risk of financial crime.
In 2012, we launched our Global 
Standards initiative, focused on putting  
in place the most effective standards to 
combat financial crime across our 
operations globally. As part of this  
effort, we designed and implemented 
new, globally consistent policies on  
AML and sanctions that often extend 
beyond the requirements of local laws 
and regulations. Since 2013, we also 
established a Financial System 
Vulnerabilities Committee (‘FSVC’)  
to oversee our financial crime risk 
management reforms. The FSVC reports  
to the Board on matters relating to 
financial crime and financial system 
abuse, and provides a forward-looking 
perspective on financial crime risk, 
anti-bribery and corruption.
Among other steps, we hired experienced 
senior personnel to lead the effort and 
significantly increased our financial crime 
compliance capabilities; we put in place  
a robust investigations capability; we 
improved and expanded our financial 
crime compliance training initiatives;  
and we upgraded or replaced key 
compliance IT systems, with over  
$1bn spent since 2015.
Beyond these improvements, as part of 
our commitment to protect the integrity  
of the financial system, and to do our part 
to fight financial crime, we continue to 
enhance our systems and are working to 
integrate our reforms into our day-to-day 
risk management practices so that our 
programme is effective and sustainable 
over the long term. We are also renewing 
our focus on anti-bribery and corruption 
as part of a dedicated three-year 
programme to advance the Group’s 
anti-bribery and corruption risk 
management capability. As part of our 
commitment to the UN Global Compact, 
we have pledged to work against 
corruption in all its forms, including 
extortion and bribery.
The AML DPA expired in December 2017, 
and we are pleased that our progress in 
strengthening our AML and sanctions 
compliance capabilities has been 
recognised. Our work in this area will 
continue to be consistent with our 
strategic priority of safeguarding our 
customers and delivering industry-leading 
financial crime standards.
Over the coming years, we aim to evolve 
significantly our approach to financial 
crime risk management by building 
advanced analytical capabilities, 
including artificial intelligence, designed 
to help us target illicit conduct with 
greater sophistication and precision.  
This will help us make a step change  
in our effectiveness at fighting financial 
crime and set a new standard that aims 
to lead the industry. We expect to be 
faster and more accurate at detecting 
potential financial crime and ever more 
targeted in our risk assessments. We 
expect to generate actionable insight that 
we can use ourselves and provide to law 
enforcement to help keep criminals out 
of the financial system. This will benefit 
the Group, our customers and society  
at large.

initiatives, see page 41.
