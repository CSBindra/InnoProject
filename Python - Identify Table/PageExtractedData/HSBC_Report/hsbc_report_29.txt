Sustainable  
finance 
We aspire to be a global partner for  
the public and private sector by helping 
governments and companies achieve 
their sustainability goals, and enable a 
transition to a low-carbon economy.
Supporting our customers
We are embedding sustainability into 
the products and services we offer to 
customers, including access to capital 
markets, lending, transaction banking, 
advisory services, and investments. We 
are one of the biggest issuers for green, 
social and sustainable (‘GSS’) bonds. In 
2018, we were the number one issuer of 
sustainable bonds globally and number 
two for GSS bonds overall, according  
to data provider Dealogic. In 2018, we 
were recognised by Euromoney as the 
Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in 
Asia for our efforts to innovate products 
to address customers’ evolving needs.
Extel ranked us top for climate change 
research for a fifth consecutive year  
in 2018. In addition, our businesses 
provided a number of reports to help 
inform customers on sustainability 
considerations, including Low-carbon 
transition scenarios: Exploring scenario 
analysis for equity valuations by HSBC 
Asset Management, and Sustainability 
guidebook for treasurers by Global 
Liquidity and Cash Management.
We held over 2,500 customer meetings 
in 2018 for our largest clients in GB&M 
and CMB to discuss sustainable finance 
options and opportunities. We are 
building the knowledge and capabilities 
of our people through continued training 
and engagement. We introduced a  
new series of learning modules on 
sustainability through our online HSBC 
University for all employees, as well as 
tailored sustainability training sessions 
for key customer-facing employees and 
people in risk management roles. More 
than 2,300 employees participated in 
targeted sustainable finance training.
Driving market innovation 
We look for opportunities to develop 
and expand the market for sustainable 
finance, and contributed to a number of 
market precedents in 2018. HSBC acted 
as sole green structuring adviser for the 
Republic of Indonesia’s green Islamic 
bond, known as a sukuk, which marked 
the first sovereign green sukuk (see the 
case study on the following page).
We played an active role in the 
development of the Green Loan 
Principles introduced in 2018 and 
engaged with customers to provide 
lending that conforms to these industry-
recognised guidelines. We acted as  
the sole green finance adviser and joint 
mandated lead arranger and bookrunner 
for the first green loan in Hong Kong. We 
also launched a lending scheme in Hong 
Kong that allows customers to earn cash 
rewards for making carbon savings.
Demonstrating leadership
We are helping lead the development of 
the sustainable finance market through 
our own actions. In 2018, we issued the 
world’s first sukuk linked to the United 
Nation’s Sustainable Development  
Goals (‘SDGs’) with the help of our 
Islamic banking arm in Malaysia. See 
www.hsbc.com/investors/fixed-income-
investors/green-and-sustainability-bonds 
for the impact reports related to our 
green and sustainability bonds. We 
published 25 reports in the inaugural 
year of HSBC’s Centre of Sustainable 
Finance, which was launched in 2018  
to provide sustainability-related thought 
leadership and innovation. These efforts 
aim to strengthen understanding and 
debate across the financial industry  
and among other stakeholders. 
Further opportunities
We recognise the potential we have as a 
global universal bank to help facilitate the 
transition to a low-carbon economy and 
support other sustainability goals. As  
we continue to develop our programme  
of initiatives, we see particular 
opportunities to help our customers 
embed sustainability throughout their 
supply chains and to work with more 
carbon-intensive industries to respond  
to climate change challenges.
Our HSBC Navigator survey, which  
polls over 8,500 businesses in 34 
markets on the global business 
environment, included a focus in 2018 on 
trade and sustainability. Nearly one-third 
of businesses surveyed plan to make 
sustainability-related changes to their 
supply chains within the next three years. 
The survey identified financial gain, cost 
efficiency and sustainability goals as 
primary drivers for these changes. We 
aim to expand our efforts to provide 
working capital and term lending 
solutions that facilitate sustainability 
practices along supply chains.
