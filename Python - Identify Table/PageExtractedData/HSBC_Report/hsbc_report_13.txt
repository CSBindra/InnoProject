larger issues to executive management. 
Since introducing the programme in  
late 2017, over 8,000 issues have been 
raised, and in 2018 more than 6,500  
were resolved.  
Sales quality
To assure the quality of our sales process 
and employees’ behaviour in each of our 
markets, we either conduct a mystery 
shopping programme or a sales quality 
programme, or both. Issues identified are 
treated seriously. Action is taken to help 
achieve a fair outcome for customers.
Where concerns are found, we will 
contact the customer to explain and 
remediate. Depending on the severity  
of the issue, the relevant employee will 
be given enhanced training to improve 
their behaviour and they may become 
ineligible for an incentive reward 
payment. Where a case of misconduct 
occurs, disciplinary action may be  
taken, which can lead to dismissal.   
Front-line employee incentives
In 2013, we changed our front-line 
incentives to create a discretionary 
framework rather than a straight formula 
between sales and reward. Our people 
are now recognised for demonstrating 
our values and behaviours as well as 
meeting customers’ needs through 
products and services. The framework 
exists to recognise our front-line 
employees who go above and beyond  
for the customer, to deliver fair outcomes 
and support the sustainable growth of 
our business.
Aligned to our customer experience 
standards, the incentive framework 
assesses how our people listen to our 
customers to understand their needs  
so that they can provide appropriate 
solutions. Should an individual 
demonstrate behaviours that do not  
align with our core values, there is a 
disciplinary process that again can  
affect reward payments.
Building financial capability 
Delivering fair outcomes for customers 
also involves providing tools and content 
that help customers have the confidence 
and competence to make the most of 
their money. In 2018, we made public 
commitments around building financial 
capability, and we took a number of 
actions to deliver on these commitments:
 – In the UK, we launched the HSBC 
Connected Money app, which helps 
users see all their banking relationships 
in one place and keep track of how  
they spend their money. It has been 
downloaded 240,000 times. One  
recent new feature allows users to  
keep track of savings goals using  
virtual savings pots.
 –We introduced card control features  
in the UK, Hong Kong and Mexico,  
so customers can control their  
card spending and receive real-time 
alerts on their activity. In Mexico, 
customers can set spending limits  
and block spending categories,  
such as online shopping and 
entertainment, including gambling.
 For further details on how we support  
building financial capability and inclusion,  
see pages 34 and 44.
Managing fraud
Fraudulent activities are a risk and  
a concern for our customers. We  
are committed to mitigating and 
reducing their impact through a  
range of actions, including new fraud 
prevention systems, improvements to 
our internal processes and procedures, 
as well as communications to raise 
awareness. We introduced an automated 
customer contact solution, which uses 
two-way SMS messaging, in the second 
half of 2018. Since its introduction, 
around 4,000 customers per day are  
able to respond instantly to our fraud 
enquiries to either unblock their card  
or report fraud. Approximately half of  
all card fraud-related queries are now 
resolved without the need of a phone 
conversation, which has saved 
customers approximately 87,000 calls 
every month. We plan to introduce this  
service to more of our customers 
throughout 2019.
Operational resilience 
HSBC invests in the reliability and 
resilience of our systems to help prevent 
disruption to customers. During 2018,  
we continued to upgrade our IT systems, 
simplifying our service provision and 
replacing older IT infrastructure and 
applications. These enhancements led  
to continued global improvements in 
service availability during the year for 
both our customers and employees.
 For further details on how we aim to maintain 
and continually improve our operational 
resilience capability, see page 19.
