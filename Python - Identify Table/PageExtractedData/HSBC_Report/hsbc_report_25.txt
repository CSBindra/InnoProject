When things go wrong 
Spotlight: Conduct
Having a culture where our people  
feel able to speak up is important.  
Our people are encouraged to raise 
concerns about wrongdoing or unethical 
conduct through their normal reporting 
and escalation channels. However, we 
understand that in some circumstances 
people prefer a more discreet way to 
raise their concerns.  
Whistleblowing 
HSBC Confidential is a global platform 
that allows people to raise concerns 
outside of our normal reporting and 
escalation channels in confidence  
and without fear of retaliation. This  
is available to all of our people, past  
and present, in all global businesses, 
functions and entities.
Within this platform, we have  
multiple channels to raise issues,  
including telephone hotlines, online 
portals and email. A broad range of  
cases, covering a range of severity  
levels, are dealt with each year. We also 
monitor an external email address for 
concerns about accounting, internal 
financial controls or auditing matters  
(accountingdisclosures@hsbc.com).  
In 2019, we plan to expand our use of  
an independent third-party supplier to 
manage our 24/7 reporting hotline and 
ensure the service is available in the 
Group’s key local languages. 
We rely on our people to deliver fair 
outcomes for our customers and make 
sure we act with integrity in the financial 
markets. A high standard of personal 
conduct is critical for our ability to live  
up to this commitment and ensure  
a healthy working environment for  
our people. We actively manage 
misconduct by taking any necessary 
action, up to and including dismissal.  
We monitor and report cases on  
a regular basis to management 
All whistleblowing concerns are subject 
to an independent investigation, which  
is carried out by teams trained to handle 
sensitive cases. These include human 
resources, compliance, legal, information 
security and internal audit. Cases are 
allocated depending on the concerns 
raised. In 2018, 74% related to people, 
12% to security and fraud, 11% to 
compliance, and the remaining 3% to 
other categories. Following investigation, 
we take appropriate action if necessary, 
including disciplinary action or 
adjustments to variable pay and/or 
performance and behaviour ratings.  
We learn lessons and change our 
processes where needed. 
HSBC does not condone or tolerate 
retaliation against people who raise 
concerns and we strictly enforce  
our policy relating to this. Senior 
management are made aware of cases 
alleging retaliation and the outcome or 
action taken. Making malicious or false 
claims is incompatible with our values 
and such instances are taken seriously. 
Our Group Audit Committee  
has responsibility for oversight of 
whistleblowing arrangements and 
receives regular updates on the status  
of whistleblowing case volumes,  
themes and outcomes.
committees. In 2019, we aim to develop 
our reporting and analysis of themes and 
action taken.
Bullying and harassment are not 
tolerated at HSBC and we have strict 
processes to manage these types of 
behaviour. At the end of 2018, our Group 
Chief Executive addressed the topic 
directly with senior leaders. In 2019,  
we aim to centralise the monitoring of 
any bullying and harassment cases.
