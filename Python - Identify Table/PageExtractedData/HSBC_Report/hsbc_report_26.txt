A healthy and  
diverse workforce 
At HSBC, diversity is not just about a 
particular demographic group. It is about 
who we are, what we have learned and 
the experience we have gained. We seek 
to reflect the diversity of the markets we 
serve, not only in our people but also  
by encouraging diversity across our 
customers, communities and suppliers.
We believe in an enterprise-wide 
approach to diversity and inclusion.  
In 2018, we made good progress in 
updating our global procurement 
processes to improve supplier diversity 
and will continue this in 2019. We 
conducted a refresh of our brand to 
include inclusive imagery and principles 
so our customers and people can see 
themselves in HSBC. We have introduced 
talking cash machines and sign language 
services on smartphones to provide 
‘barrier-free banking’ and insurance 
products for same sex couples in Hong 
Kong. We know there is still more to do. 
Gender balance
Gender balance in leadership is an area 
where we are making progress but 
recognise the need to improve. We have 
signed up to the 30% Club campaign 
commitment to reach 30% women in 
senior leadership roles by the end of 2020. 
In 2018, 28.2% of our senior leadership 
were women, above our goal of 27.6%.  
In 2019, we are aiming for 29%. 
To help improve gender balance in  
senior roles we provide mentoring and 
sponsorship opportunities for talented 
women. We extended our Accelerating 
Female Leaders programme in our  
GB&M business to include our CMB and 
GPB businesses. Through sponsorship,  
the programme builds visibility and 
connectivity for Director-level female 
talent with leaders from across the Group. 
In 2018, 28.2% of our senior leadership  
were women, above our goal of 27.6%.
Our employee networks
Our seven global employee networks and 
our HSBC Communities discuss issues our 
people care about and challenge us on 
where we could be doing better. We have 
more than 140 groups with over 80,000 
participants. The networks focus on 
gender, age, ethnicity, LGBT+, faith, 
working parents and carers, and ability 
(including mental health). Our HSBC 
Communities focus on a variety of 
common interest topics including flexible 
working, military and veterans, and 
Chinese culture. These groups play an 
important role in helping us make progress. 
Our largest global network, with over 
48,000 participants, is Balance, which 
works to improve gender balance.
In 2018, we introduced a global 
management structure for our LGBT+ 
network, Pride, to help network growth 
and share best practice.
Spotlight: Gender pay gap 
Gender pay is an area of particular focus in the UK with the introduction of 
the Gender Pay Gap (‘GPG’) Reporting regulations. We have complied with  
the regulations and reported our 2017/2018 GPG. Our UK gender pay gap is 
driven by the gender imbalance within our businesses and functions. There  
are fewer women in senior leadership roles, meaning that we have more men 
earning higher salaries. A higher proportion of women work in more junior  
roles or work part-time hours. 
We are committed to improving gender balance and are taking a number  
of specific steps that we expect to have a positive impact in the UK over  
time, including:
 –driving better gender balance at all levels in the organisation;
 –developing female talent to strengthen the leadership pipeline; 
 –supporting families and flexibility; and 
 –retaining female talent.
We are confident in our approach to pay and where we have identified pay 
differences that cannot be explained, we have made appropriate adjustments.
