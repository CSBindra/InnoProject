Cybersecurity
We operate in an increasingly sophisticated 
and hostile cyber threat environment. In 
response, we are investing in business 
and technical controls to help prevent, 
detect and react to these cyber threats.   
We are strengthening our controls to 
help protect against advanced malware, 
data leakage, infiltration of payment 
systems and denial of service attacks  
as well as enhancing our ability to  
detect and respond to cyber-attacks.  
An important part of our defence 
strategy is ensuring our employees 
remain cyber-aware and know how to 
report incidents. We continually evaluate 
the threat environment for the most 
prevalent attack types and their potential 
outcomes in order to determine the most 
effective controls. 
We operate a three lines of defence 
model, aligned to the operational risk 
management framework, to identify, 
report and manage cyber risks within  
the organisation. Global business and 
function risk owners in the first line are 
accountable for identifying, owning and 
managing the cyber risk. They work with 
control owners to help ensure controls 
are in place to mitigate issues, prevent 
risk events occurring and resolve risk 
events if they do occur. These controls 
are executed in line with policies 
produced by the second line information 
security risk teams and are overseen by 
the third line – the independent Internal 
Audit function. 
Cyber risk and control effectiveness  
was reviewed 11 times at non-executive 
Director level, including by the Board, 
Group Risk Committee and Group Audit 
Committee. It is also reported across the 
global businesses, functions and regions 
to help ensure appropriate visibility  
and governance of the risk and its 
mitigating controls.
We participate in several industry bodies 
and working groups to discuss cyber 
risks, including the following:
 –attendee of key banking association 
cyber working groups in all regions, 
including groups run by the Association 
for Financial Markets in Europe and the 
Hong Kong Association of Banks;
 –contributor to the UK’s National Cyber 
Security Centre, specifically through 
the Cyber Security Information Sharing 
Partnership initiative;
 –member of the following three chapters 
of the Financial Services Information 
Sharing and Analysis Center: the  
US, UK and Europe, and Asia-Pacific 
chapters; 
 –member of the Institute of International 
Finance cyber working group;
 –contributor to the Cyber Security 
Industry Group, a financial services 
industry-led information exchange 
forum in the UK; and
 –member of government-led computer 
emergency response teams in major 
markets, including the UK, US and 
Hong Kong.
Operational resilience
Operational resilience is the ability  
to adapt operations to continue 
functioning when – not if – circumstances 
change. We have a clear strategic 
approach to operational resilience 
considered from three perspectives,  
while putting the impact on our 
customers and colleagues at the centre  
of our thinking: how we architect, design 
and build systems and services; how  
we operate, run and monitor our control 
environment; and how we respond and 
recover in the event of disruption.  
Data privacy
We are committed to protecting the 
privacy of data we hold and process,  
in accordance with the laws and 
regulations of the geographies we operate 
in. We are focused on embedding a 
culture designed to ensure data privacy  
is at the heart of our organisation.
In 2018, there were significant changes  
to EU data privacy laws, with the General 
Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) 
coming into effect across the EU, while 
new data privacy legislation came into 
force in some non-EU jurisdictions. The 
introduction of the GDPR provided us with 
an opportunity to review and reinforce our 
data privacy policies and controls across 
the Group, giving customers, employees 
and stakeholders more transparency and 
control over how we use and manage 
their information. A dedicated programme 
of work was mobilised to execute and 
embed GDPR requirements within HSBC 
ahead of its coming into force. We 
continue to develop and focus our privacy 
capabilities in areas such as safeguards, 
privacy impact and risk assessments, staff 
training, education and raising awareness. 
Data privacy is regularly reported at 
multiple Group-level governance forums, 
which include Board level representation 
to help ensure appropriate challenge  
and visibility among senior stakeholders. 
In addition, data privacy governance 
structures have been established within 
the Group. We continue to work towards 
embedding ownership and accountability 
of data governance across all businesses 
and functions in an effort to ensure 
effective management of risks.
Increasing complexity in the matrix  
of global data privacy laws, recent 
developments in data localisation 
requirements and the emergence of  
new data-driven technologies continue  
to challenge the banking industry. They 
also bring opportunities to serve our 
customers better, and we recognise that 
data privacy and concepts such as privacy 
by design are fundamental to achieving 
this. We continue to work closely with 
data privacy regulators, industry bodies 
and external stakeholders around the 
world to stay abreast of regulatory 
developments in this area.
