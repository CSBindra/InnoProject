Safeguarding the  
financial system  
We continued to consolidate our 
progress in tackling financial crime  
while launching initiatives in a number  
of new areas.
Our Global Standards programme, 
launched in 2013 to upgrade our financial 
crime controls, is now approaching its 
conclusion. During 2018, we concentrated 
on completing some of the final elements 
of the programme designed to ensure 
management of financial crime risk is well 
embedded in our day-to-day activities, 
with robust governance and reporting to 
enable performance to be assessed. 
In June, we set out new strategic priorities 
including the aim of delivering industry-
leading financial crime standards. 
Developing an intelligence-led approach  
to financial crime risk management using 
new technologies and advanced analytical 
techniques is key to achieving this 
ambitious target. We made good progress 
on this agenda and will continue to develop 
our approach in 2019 and beyond.
We launched an anti-bribery and 
corruption transformation programme, to 
enhance the policies and controls around 
identifying and managing these risks 
across the Group. We also launched a 
transformation programme to strengthen 
our ability to fight fraud and protect  
our customers. 
 For more information on our Global Standards 
and anti-bribery and corruption programmes, 
see pages 37 to 39.
Technology 
Technologies such as artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and advanced analytics will 
enable us to tackle financial crime more effectively. Our approach combines 
developing our own technology solutions with bringing in the best external 
technology. 
Our investment in a start-up company called Quantexa enabled our investigators 
in 2018 to deploy a new software system to spot financial crime networks in near 
real time by looking at internal and external data to find possible links between 
individuals or companies. Working with another fintech company, Caspian,  
we have developed a system that assembles all the relevant information on a 
particular suspicious transaction. It then uses AI to recommend whether it should 
be investigated further, enabling our people to focus on the highest priority cases. 
Our flagship intelligence-led initiative is a new approach that combines a  
range of data sources to dynamically assess the potential financial crime risk 
that an individual customer presents. We believe it will enable us to be faster 
and more accurate at detecting suspicious activity and more granular in our  
risk assessments. During 2018, we developed a prototype that, while at an  
early stage, has proved to be markedly better at finding potential financial  
crime than existing industry-standard methods. We will begin to implement  
it in 2019, alongside existing systems. We continue to engage with regulators 
on our approach.
Partnerships
The insights delivered by new technology will have the greatest impact when 
we work with partners. Public-private partnerships enable banks to share 
information with each other, regulators and law enforcement. We are a 
member of all six public-private financial crime partnerships that have been 
established around the world. Through our membership we can provide 
better insight about suspicious transactions to law enforcement and receive 
intelligence that helps us to better target our work in detecting financial crime.
We continue to advocate for partnerships in other jurisdictions and for  
the effective operation of existing partnerships, including sponsoring public 
research into the future of financial intelligence sharing due to be released  
in 2019.
Society 
During 2018, we successfully trialled an approach to providing victims of 
human trafficking in the UK with monitored retail banking facilities, working 
closely with charities that provide support to victims. The aim is to help the 
victims reintegrate with society and break the cycle of abuse. The accounts 
were trialled through a small number of branches and we will now make them 
available in other areas of the UK. 
Financial crime can have a devastating impact on the societies that we serve, 
and we have taken active steps to reduce that impact. In October, we joined 
the task force established by United for Wildlife to coordinate financial firms 
tackling the illegal wildlife trade by helping prevent the flow of illicit profits. 
Members of the task force signed up to a declaration that commits them to 
steps such as providing intelligence about the trade to regulatory bodies and 
law enforcement agencies. 
The scale of our work 
Each month, we screen over 658 
million transactions across 207 
million accounts for signs of money 
laundering and financial crime. In 
addition, we screen approximately 
130 million customers and 37.3 
million transactions monthly for 
sanctions exposures. During 2018, 
we filed over 85,000 suspicious 
activity reports to law enforcement 
and regulatory authorities where we 
identified potential financial crime.
