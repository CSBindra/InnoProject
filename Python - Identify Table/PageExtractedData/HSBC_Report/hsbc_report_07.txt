Our stakeholders
Building strong relationships with our stakeholders will  
help enable us to deliver our strategy in line with long-term 
values, and operate the business in a sustainable way.
Engaging with our stakeholders 
Assessing materiality
Our stakeholders are the 
people who work for us, bank 
with us, own us, regulate us, 
and live in the societies we 
serve and the planet we  
all inhabit. These human 
connections are complex  
and overlap. Many of our 
employees are customers  
and shareholders, while our 
business customers are often 
suppliers. We exist to serve, 
creating value for our 
customers and shareholders. 
Our size and global reach 
mean our actions can have  
a significant impact, which  
is why we want to create  
the healthiest human system 
in financial services to help 
enable our business strategy.
We listen to our stakeholders in a number of different ways, 
from employee and customer surveys to client meetings. 
Investors tell us what matters to them in the annual ESG 
investor survey and in qualitative assessments during investor 
meetings. We are also informed by stock exchange listing  
and disclosure rules in Hong Kong, the UK and the US.
We use this information to identify what issues are material  
to our stakeholders, taking into account the nature of our 
business. In line with the provisions of the ESG Guide,  
an issue is considered to be material when management 
determines that it has become sufficiently important to  
our stakeholders that it should be publicly reported.
Management tables material issues for discussion at the  
ESG Steering Committee and other relevant governance 
forums. We use these themes and concerns as a guide  
for our ESG Update. Further information about the ESG 
Steering Committee is included in the ‘Ensuring strong 
corporate governance’ section of the report on page 40. 
We acknowledge that material issues evolve over time,  
and we will continue to assess them to ensure we remain 
current in our approach and communications.
