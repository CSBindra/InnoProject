Customer tax evasion 
Prior to 2011, our Swiss private bank 
provided its customers with standard 
services, common in the Swiss banking 
industry at the time, which enabled 
customers to conceal their assets from 
tax authorities and avoid paying their 
taxes. These services included, among 
other things, the opening of encoded 
numbered accounts that kept the 
account holder’s name confidential  
and the provision of ‘hold mail’ services 
whereby all mail was kept at the bank  
for customers to avoid receiving letters  
at their domestic addresses. Our Swiss 
private bank, through certain of its 
relationship managers, offered these 
services while it had access to 
information enabling it to know, or  
to suspect, that certain customers would 
use those services in order to conceal 
their assets from tax authorities.
While HSBC has reached agreements 
with certain law enforcement authorities 
to resolve investigations relating to 
allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, 
money laundering and unlawful cross-
border banking solicitation arising  
out of these past practices, the Group 
continues to cooperate in ongoing 
investigations by other tax 
administration, regulatory and law 
enforcement authorities around the 
world in connection with similar 
allegations. We acknowledge that the 
compliance culture and standards of due 
diligence in our Swiss private bank were 
significantly lower in 2006 and 2007 than 
they are today. With hindsight, it is clear 
that we maintained too many small and 
high-risk customer accounts and our 
private banking business was stretched 
over too many geographical markets,  
all of which contributed to failings in 
standards, culture and controls. 
In recent years, our Global Private 
Banking (‘GPB’) business has taken 
significant steps to address these 
historical control weaknesses, most 
notably in Switzerland. Beginning in 
2012, GPB developed a tax transparency 
policy that included enhanced know your 
customer (‘KYC’) and AML procedures 
and a review of existing accounts against 
potential indicators of non-compliance 
with tax obligations. Accounts were 
closed where issues were identified
