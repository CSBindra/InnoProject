Our approach to partnerships continued
Our corporate volunteering
We operate across 66 countries so  
when our employees volunteer their time 
and expertise, we can have a truly global 
impact. We are committed to helping our 
people contribute to their communities, 
and we encourage volunteering through 
paid volunteering days. In 2018, our 
employees gave 264,000 hours to 
community activities during work time. 
This represented a decrease from 2017 
(272,000 hours), although the average 
amount of time contributed per FTE 
remained broadly consistent. 
As well as benefiting the communities 
we serve, volunteering can bring great 
personal rewards, enabling people to 
build connections, develop new skills, 
and gain a fresh perspective.
We organise volunteer opportunities  
that help enable our people to address 
challenges within the community, 
including developing employability  
and financial capability skills needed to 
succeed in the future. We also support our 
people organising their own volunteering 
initiatives and involving colleagues. 
Personal employee-led volunteering  
is actively encouraged and currently 
accounts for a third of the volunteering  
in which our people participate.
Supporting disaster relief efforts
As part of our community programme, 
we provide money to support disaster 
relief based on need. We ensure we 
listen to our local colleagues and  
support the best-placed charities on a 
case-by-case basis. We provide support 
and disaster relief to many areas during 
catastrophic events such as fires,  
floods, tsunamis and hurricanes. 
We expect to help 
850
facilities to improve their environmental  
and social impact by the end of 2020
Case study: HSBC Living 
Business programme
The HSBC Living Business programme 
supports the development of 
sustainable supply chains. It provides 
a learning platform for small and 
medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’)  
to understand industry best practice, 
and it recognises organisations 
adopting new approaches. Through 
partnerships with customers, NGOs 
and other stakeholders, we are 
helping businesses to transition  
to more sustainable supply chain 
models. Since 2018, ESG and UN 
Sustainable Development Goals have 
been introduced to the programme 
for enhancing the international 
growth and connectivity of SMEs.
264,000 hours

activities during working hours in 2018
The United Nations (‘UN’) Sustainable 
Development Goals (‘SDGs’) are 17 goals  
and 169 targets to be achieved by 2030.  
These SDGs are a call to action to protect  
the planet, end poverty, and ensure peace  
and prosperity. Achieving the goals requires 
partnerships between governments, the  
private sector and civil society. 
We have a responsibility to contribute to this 
globally agreed framework for action. By aligning 
our values, conduct and business activity, the 
SDGs set the context for our long-term ambition. 
Material areas are disclosed as part of this ESG 
Update in line with the reporting guidance in 
the practical guide published by UN Global 
Compact and Global Reporting Initiative1.
In the adjacent graphic, we have highlighted  
the six SDG targets we prioritise for their close 
alignment to our strategy. We will contribute  
to these through our financing and investments, 
as well as how we conduct business and operate.
Demonstrating our support of the goals we 
have issued two SDG bonds, with the proceeds 
being used to support projects that offer broad 
social, economic and environmental benefits as 
aligned to seven selected SDG goals. Further 
details, including the framework and the  
bonds’ first impact reports may be found  
on www.hsbc.com/investors/fixed-income-
investors/green-and-sustainability-bonds.
