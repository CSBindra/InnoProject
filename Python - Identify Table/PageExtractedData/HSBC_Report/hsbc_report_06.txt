1. A full progress update on our strategic priorities is available on pages 12 and 13 of our Annual Report and Accounts 2018.
2.  Return on tangible equity (‘RoTE’) is calculated as reported profit attributable to ordinary shareholders less changes in goodwill and present value of 
in-force long-term insurance business divided by average tangible equity. A targeted reported RoTE of greater than 11% in 2020 is broadly equivalent  
to a reported return on equity (‘RoE’) of 10%, and assumes a Group CET1 ratio greater than 14%.
* For footnotes 10, 11, 14, 17 and 21, see page 67 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2018. 
Return to growth and value creation 
We entered the next phase of our strategy in 2018, focused on growth and creating value for our stakeholders. In our June 2018 
Strategy Update we outlined eight strategic priorities to deliver growth, improve returns, empower our people, and enhance our 
customer experience. Each priority has a target or set of targeted outcomes by 2020.
