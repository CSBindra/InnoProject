Our renewable electricity challenge
Since 2012, our renewable electricity strategy has evolved  
from purchasing renewable energy credits to influencing the 
markets in which we operate by sourcing electricity through 
power purchase agreements (‘PPAs’) that provide additional 
renewable energy to a country’s energy mix. In 2017, we 
committed to ensuring that 100% of our electricity was sourced 
from renewable sources by 2030, with an interim commitment  
of 90% by 2025. Between 2012 and the end of 2018, we 
contracted up to 29% of our electricity consumption through 
PPAs in various countries. As we strive to achieve our goal,  
we are conscious of the challenges this will present, such as  
in some markets in Asia where PPAs are currently unavailable. 
We are members of global initiatives, such as RE100, a  
global initiative uniting more than 100 influential businesses 
committed to 100% renewable electricity, that aim to create  
a united corporate voice to influence countries’ policy to open 
markets. However, in some smaller Asian markets, our electricity 
consumption is too small for projects to be economically viable, 
and therefore we will look to partner with other companies for  
a collaborative solution. By finding solutions to problems our 
customers and other companies face, we are in turn solving  
our own similar challenges, and vice versa. 
Our waste challenge
Our 2020 target was to reduce our total waste by 50% from our 
2011 baseline. This was achieved in 2015, and then stretched  
to reduce by 75% from this 2011 baseline. At 2018, we had 
reduced total waste by 63%.
Our recycling target is for 100% of our office and electronic 
waste to be recycled by 2020. Since 2011, we have recycled 
61% of our office waste. 
We are progressing well on our waste reduction target, however 
our recycling goal will be a challenge to achieve. As we continue 
to reduce our total waste, it becomes increasingly challenging to 
increase or maintain recycling levels. 
With differences within cities and buildings, we continue to 
address the waste challenge by finding ways to reduce waste, 
segregate and recycle. Most importantly, we continue to 
engage with our employees to better explain and further 
educate on local waste and recycling challenges.
