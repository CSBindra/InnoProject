The information set out in  
this document, taken together 
with the information relating 
to environmental, social and 
governance (‘ESG’) issues in our 
HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report 
and Accounts 2018, aims to 
provide key ESG information and 
data relevant to our operations 
for the year ended 31 December 
2018. In this context, we have 
also considered our obligations 
under the Environmental, Social 
and Governance Reporting Guide 
contained in Appendix 27 to The 
Rules Governing the Listing of 
Securities on the Stock Exchange  
of Hong Kong Limited (‘ESG Guide’). 
 
To the extent that we have not 
complied with the relevant ‘comply 
or explain’ provisions in the ESG 
Guide, it is because we have chosen 
to focus on issues that we consider 
are material to our stakeholders, 
taking into account the nature of 
our business. This is aligned with 
the materiality reporting principle 
that is set out in the ESG Guide. 
Please see ‘Assessing materiality’ 
on page 5 for further information  
on how we determine what issues 
are material to our stakeholders.  
We will continue to develop and 
refine our reporting and disclosures 
on ESG issues in line with feedback 
received from our investors and 
other stakeholders, and in view  
of our obligations under the  
ESG Guide.
