Acting on feedback
Area of focus Action
Making banking 
accessible
We have expanded rolling out our simplified login process. Apple’s Touch ID is now live in 18 markets and HSBC Voice ID  
is in five markets. Last year, 80% of customer transactions were conducted via mobile or online channels. More than 30%  
of loans, cards and deposits sales were through digital channels.
In the UK, we trained our front-line people to become more digitally proficient. In branch or on the phone, they can show 
customers how to complete tasks digitally. Last year, 85% of new customers opened accounts through a supported  
digital experience.
Making our  
processes easier
In the UK, we are simplifying our mortgage process. Applications can be approved within 10 days with the help of 
automatic valuations, improved credit policies and increased underwriter availability.
To make investing more accessible, we equipped our branch employees in Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore 
with mobile tablets, and launched an online financial health check. Customers can now understand their investment 
options in their own time, without a specialist appointment. For more information on our digital enhancements, please  
see ‘Our investment in technology’ on page 18.
Making it easy to 
understand us and  
our fees and charges
In Singapore, we simplified our mortgage application forms and offer letters, so customers can be clear about their 
repayment schedule, terms and conditions, and fees and charges. 
Through digital messaging we are raising customer awareness around overdrafts in the UK, Hong Kong, France and the  
US. In the UK, we expanded the volume of overdraft alerts, which we first introduced in 2017, sending more than 26 million 
alerts in 2018 to help customers save money. Over half (56%) of customers who receive an alert pay in funds to avoid 
charges. To help even more customers avoid fees, we are introducing services like our Connected Money app, which  
helps people keep track of their spending (see page 11).
When things go wrong
We aim to ensure customers’ complaints 
are recorded so we can understand what 
went wrong and why, and then act upon 
the feedback. Complaints are monitored 
and reported to governance forums. 
Senior executives are measured against 
complaint-handling performance. 
The way we handle complaints and how 
fast we respond is important to us and our 
customers. In 2018, we resolved 77% of 
complaints on the same or next working 
day, and 86% within five working days, 
excluding UK complaints related to 
payment protection insurance (‘PPI’).  
The most common complaints related to 
process and procedures (39%), service 
(25%), and fees and charges (9%).
In 2018, we received approximately 1.2 
million complaints from retail customers  
in our large markets referenced in the 
adjacent table, a 16% increase compared 
with 2017, primarily driven by the UK and 
Mexico. The increase in UK complaints 
mainly related to PPI, which is consistent 
across the UK industry, and to digital 
registration issues. An improvement 
programme for non-PPI complaints was 
introduced in 2018, resulting in complaint 
volumes declining in the fourth quarter. Our 
business in Mexico experienced an increase 
in complaints due to the prevalence of 
online fraud transactions leading to service 
interruption. We provided refunds to the 
customers and strengthened our fraud 
control measures, as well as launching a 
card control app that allows customers to 
manage deactivating controls on online 
card usage. As of September 2018, the 
Financial Services Consumers Protection 
Bureau in Mexico ranked HSBC as the best 
bank among the seven largest banks for 
complaint resolution and quality of service 
on their Customer Care Performance Index. 
Complaints at our UAE business fell 18%, 
but remained relatively high. Complaints 
were primarily due to manual processes, 
service delays, staff knowledge and clarity 
of our communication to customers. These 
continue to be addressed through a 
customer experience programme.
1.  A complaint is defined as ‘any expression  
of dissatisfaction, whether upheld or not, from  
(or on behalf of) a former, existing or prospective 
customer relating to the provision of, or failure to 
provide, a specific product or service activity’.
