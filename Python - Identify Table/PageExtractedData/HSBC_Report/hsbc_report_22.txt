Our relationship
Our people at HSBC span many 
cultures, communities and continents. 
We want to build trusted relationships, 
where our people feel empowered  
in their roles and inspired to grow.  
We help our leaders set the tone  
by listening and valuing the  
behaviours that get a job done  
as much as the outcome. 
We understand the importance  
of building a diverse and inclusive 
workforce, valuing individuals and  
their contribution. This allows us to 
better represent our customers and  
the communities we serve. The path  
to achieving the healthiest human 
system is being defined by our people 
in conversations around the world.
