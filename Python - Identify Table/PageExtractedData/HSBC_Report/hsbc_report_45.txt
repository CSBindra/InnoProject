Respecting  
human rights 
Business does not exist in isolation: it  
is part of communities and serves the 
people. We recognise the duty of states 
to protect human rights and the role 
played by business in respecting them,  
in line with the UN Guiding Principles’ 
(‘UNGPs’) Protect, Respect and Remedy 
framework. We have signed, or 
expressed support for, a number of 
international codes, as set out in our 
2015 Statement on Human Rights.
In 2018, we set up a Human Rights 
Steering Committee, which is overseeing 
the development of our approach to 
human rights. This approach will 
incorporate new recommendations from 
initiatives such as the OECD’s general  
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible 
Business Conduct, published in May 2018. 
We primarily reflect human rights 
considerations as they apply to our 
people, our suppliers and our customers. 
Some examples are provided below.
Employees
We are committed to an inclusive  
culture where our people can be 
confident that their views matter, their 
workplace is an environment free from 
bias, discrimination and harassment,  
and where they can see that 
advancement is based on merit. This 
commitment reflects the provisions of 
both the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (‘the UDHR’) and the International 
Labour Organization Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work (‘the ILO Declaration’), including 
freedom of association. For further 
details on the diversity of our workforce, 
see page 24.
Suppliers
We expect our suppliers to uphold 
human rights in carrying out their 
business, reflecting the UDHR and ILO 
Declaration principles. Our ethical and 
environmental code of conduct for 
suppliers requires them to respect the 
human rights of their employees and the 
communities in which they operate, and 
comply with all relevant legislation, 
regulations and directives. During 2018, 
we undertook a risk-mapping exercise  
to identify the most salient human rights 
risks in our supply chain, particularly 
those relating to modern slavery and 
human trafficking. 
Customers
The principal aim of the UNGPs is to 
prevent human rights abuses. We seek  
to ensure that the financial services we 
provide to our customers do not result  
in an unacceptable impact on people  
or the environment. We are a signatory 
to the Equator Principles, which are 
underpinned by the International Finance 
Corporation’s Performance Standards, 
and which focus on issues including land 
rights, child labour, forced labour, and  
the rights of indigenous and local 
communities. We work with our 
customers to help them improve their 
sustainability practices. Additionally, our 
financial crime teams actively seek to 
identify the proceeds of potential human 
rights abuses to inform law enforcement 
and take ‘bad actors’ out of the financial 
system. A case study on this is contained 
in our Modern Slavery Act statement. 
 
 
Modern Slavery Act
Our statement under the UK’s  
2015 Modern Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Act gives details of our  
work in combating these particularly 
egregious human rights abuses. We are 
raising awareness with our customers  
in selected sectors and regions as part  
of our annual credit review processes. 
We are educating our own colleagues 
directly through training and indirectly 
through communications. 
Stakeholder engagement
We remain committed to developing our 
approach to managing human rights risks 
as they affect rights holders. We attended 
the UN Business and Human Rights 
Forum in November 2018 and continued 
our involvement with the Thun Group, an 
informal group of bank representatives 
that provides guidance on how the 
UNGPs should be applied across banking 
activities. We support the UN Global 
Compact’s promotion of sustainable  
and socially responsible policies, and 
participate in the UK Chapter’s Modern 
Slavery Act working group. 
In 2018, we had contact with five civil 
society groups where human rights 
abuses were raised. These abuses were 
alleged to have been committed by 
HSBC customers. We investigate 
credible allegations of human rights 
violations as they are reported to us  
via engagement with stakeholders. If 
required, particularly serious issues 
ultimately pass to the Group 
Management Board.
