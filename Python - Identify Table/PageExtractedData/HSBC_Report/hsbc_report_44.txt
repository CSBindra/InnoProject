Keeping a responsible  
approach to tax  
We seek to pay our fair share of tax in the 
jurisdictions in which we operate and to 
minimise the likelihood of customers using 
our products to avoid or evade tax. Our 
approach to tax and governance processes 
is designed to achieve these goals. 
We have established a formal tax risk 
management framework, which is 
designed to ensure that tax-motivated 
transactions or products are not adopted by 
the Group. Significant investment has been 
made to strengthen our tax risk processes 
and train staff to identify instances of 
potential tax evasion. There remain areas 
where further improvements are required 
and we are working to address these.
With respect to our own taxes, we  
are guided by the following principles:
 –We are committed to applying both  
the letter and spirit of the law in all 
jurisdictions in which we operate.  
This includes adherence to a variety  
of measures arising from the OECD  
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  
(‘BEPS’) initiative. 
 –We seek to have open and transparent 
relationships with all tax authorities.  
As with any group of our size and 
complexity, a number of areas of 
differing interpretation or disputes with 
tax authorities exist at any point in time.  
We work with the local tax authorities  
to try to agree and resolve these in a 
timely manner.
 –We have reduced the number of legal 
entities located in very low or nil tax 
jurisdictions from 121 at the beginning  
of 2015 to 46 by the end of 2018. This 
process will continue throughout 2019 
and 2020, with the aim of ensuring that 
the HSBC entities remaining in such 
jurisdictions are regulated entities 
essential for conducting business.
With respect to our customers’ taxes, we 
are guided by the following principles:
 –We have made considerable investment 
implementing processes designed to 
increase transparency and reduce the  
risk of banking services being used to 
facilitate customer tax evasion and 
financial crime. These processes 
incorporate requirements arising from 
external tax transparency initiatives 
including the US Foreign Account Tax 
Compliance Act, the OECD Standard  
for Automatic Exchange of Financial 
Account Information (the ‘Common 
Reporting Standard’), and the UK 
legislation on the corporate criminal 
offence of failing to prevent the  
facilitation of tax evasion.
 –We have processes in place to help 
ensure that tax-motivated products are 
not provided to our customers.
 For further details on our approach to  
financial crime and what steps we have  
taken, see pages 37 to 39. 
Our tax contributions
As highlighted below, in addition to paying 
$7.0bn of our own tax liabilities during 
2018, we collected taxes of $7.6bn on 
behalf of governments around the world.  
A more detailed geographical breakdown 
of the taxes paid in 2018 is provided on 
page 65 of the HSBC Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2018.
