Our approach with our suppliers
We have globally consistent standards 
and procedures for the onboarding and 
use of external suppliers. We require 
suppliers to meet our compliance and 
financial stability requirements, as well  
as to keep to our sustainability code  
of conduct. Payment on time is of 
paramount importance, and as such our 
commitment to paying our suppliers is in 
line with the UK Prompt Payment Code.
Supplier ethical code  
of conduct
We have an ethical and environmental 
code of conduct for suppliers of goods 
and services, which must be complied 
with by all suppliers. While our businesses 
and functions are accountable for  
the suppliers they use, our global 
procurement function owns the code  
of conduct review process for them. 
Our goal is to work collaboratively  
with our supply chain partners on 
sustainability at all times. When a 
supplier or one of its sub-contractors  
is found to no longer be in compliance 
with this code, we will work with them 
on an improvement plan or, if deemed 
necessary, terminate the relationship. 
The ethical code of conduct, which we 
require suppliers to adopt, sets out the 
standards for economic, environmental 
and social impacts and outlines the 
requirements of having a governance 
and management structure to ensure 
compliance with this code. 
Suppliers  
Our supplier management conduct 
principles also set out how we conduct 
business with our third-party suppliers 
both in our legal and commercial 
obligations. They also explain how  
we treat suppliers fairly through our 
behaviour and actions, in line with  
the HSBC Values.
Supplier diversity initiative
We have a connected global supply 
base and inclusive sourcing strategies 
that reflect the communities where we 
operate, and help ensure we meet the 
needs of our diverse customer base. In 
June 2018, we also developed a supplier 
diversity and inclusion action plan, 
which encourages the use of minority-
owned and SME businesses.
