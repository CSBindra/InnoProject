Our relationship
We act on our responsibility to run our 
business in a way that upholds high 
standards of corporate governance. 
We are committed to working with 
our regulators to manage the safety  
of the financial system, adhering to 
the spirit and the letter of the rules 
and regulations governing our 
industry. In our endeavour to restore 
trust in our industry, we aim to act 
with courageous integrity and learn 
from past events to prevent their 
recurrences. 
We meet our responsibility to society 
through paying taxes and being 
transparent in our approach to this. 
We also seek to ensure we respect 
global standards on human rights in 
our workplace and our supply chains, 
and continually work to improve our 
compliance management capabilities. 
We acknowledge that increasing 
financial inclusion is a continuing 
effort, and we are carrying out a 
number of initiatives to increase 
access to financial services.
