When things go wrong
Overall, the number of complaints 
increased in 2018, mainly in Global 
Liquidity and Cash Management 
(‘GLCM’) due to a number of significant 
systems upgrades and issues throughout 
the year. In most other GB&M 
businesses, the number of complaints 
either reduced or remained stable from 
2017. In Global Markets, we had a 
reduction in complaints resulting from 
human error and processing issues in  
our operations team. In Global Banking, 
the number of recorded complaints fell, 
in part due to improvements to how  
we record feedback. Previously, many 
complaints that were related to the range 
of products and services offered by 
HSBC were recorded by Global Banking, 
where the overall customer relationship 
is managed. In 2018, we have aimed, 
where possible, to record specific 
complaints in relation to products and 
services against their specific product 
line such as GLCM and Global Trade  
and Receivables Finance products.
Spotlight: Conduct
Improving employee conduct remains one 
of GB&M’s core priorities as we continue to 
pursue the highest standards across every 
aspect of our business. The way in which 
we conduct business helps us fulfil  
our purpose of connecting clients to 
opportunities and helping economies to 
grow, while staying true to our values. 
Customers rely on us for our financing, 
advisory and research expertise. They know 
we can access global debt, equity, currency 
and commodity markets. It is vital that they 
trust us to manage their liquidity, keep their 
assets safe, and finance their trade. 
In 2018, we took a fresh look at how  
to help deliver fair outcomes for our 
customers, and help ensure we do  
not cause disruption to the orderly and 
transparent operation of financial markets. 
We worked with third-party experts to 
highlight areas that needed improvement, 
which led to a comprehensive new 
programme to improve our conduct. The 
key areas of focus are highlighted below: 
Culture and environment
 –We are expanding the dialogue  
on conduct to help ensure we are 
supporting our people to make values-
based judgements in situations they  
face every day, and feel safe raising 
concerns. In the first half of 2018, 5,200 
of our people attended 650 Exchange 
meetings to discuss our conduct and 
culture, with further Exchange meetings 
held through the rest of 2018.
 –We have developed a network of conduct 
champions across the business to help 
drive conduct awareness and provide a 
group of enthusiastic, committed people 
to act as local sponsors for behavioural 
change. We have led region-specific 
conduct weeks, where we highlighted 
examples of conduct in action across the 
business, and produced and updated 
country-specific conduct handbooks. 
 –We have a complex footprint across 
different businesses, countries and desks. 
This can lead to a number of different 
cultures – some of which will have issues 
that need to be addressed. In 2018,  
we began a series of pilot exercises to 
examine the root causes of employee  
and team behaviour, and to help design 
interventions. This will continue in 2019.
 –We introduced a new hiring guide  
for managers to support the assessment  
and selection of candidates, and 
strengthen our interview process  
with a broader inclusion of values  
and behavioural measures.
 –Our management and staff wanted more 
training on conduct and how it applies  
to them and their roles. We continue  
to improve our conduct curriculum to 
meet this demand, including coverage  
of behavioural drivers, conflicts, grey 
areas and specific technical training.
Embedding conduct in core 
business processes
 –We have created a Global Markets 
product risk function and appointed 
co-Heads of Product Governance in 
Global Markets to improve product 
governance. Product due diligence 
templates used across GB&M have been 
enhanced in an effort to ensure conduct 
is more carefully considered. Sales 
suitability procedures have been 
developed for people working in Global 
Banking and the Institutional Client 
Group, and training has commenced  
for Global Markets sales employees. 
 – In our Exchange meetings on conduct  
and culture in 2018, our people provided 
feedback that they wanted more support 
understanding how pricing is determined 
to support conversations with customers 
and ensure consistency. New guidelines  
on pricing and transparency have  
since been agreed and published.
Reinforcing our controls 
framework 
 –During 2018, our businesses ran 
exercises to encourage a deeper 
understanding of the conflicts of interest 
that can occur in investment banking. 
These captured a more granular view of 
the potential situations that our people 
need to be aware of and actively manage. 
Over 100 workshops have been held to 
create an inventory of conflicts of interest 
that could arise within GB&M, bringing 
business lines and regions together. 
 –We reviewed all our Global Banking 
locations to assess whether they are 
segregated from other business lines  
from the perspective of information 
control and managing conflicts of interest.
 –We work in an environment where we are 
entrusted with privileged information that 
we have a critical responsibility to protect. 
It is vital that high levels of information 
controls are in place. Improvements in 
controls and procedures have been 
introduced during 2018. Over 31,000 
HSBC employees across all GB&M offices 
completed a bespoke training module on 
information control procedures.
 For further information on our approach to conduct 
and the steps we have taken, see pages 37 to 39.
