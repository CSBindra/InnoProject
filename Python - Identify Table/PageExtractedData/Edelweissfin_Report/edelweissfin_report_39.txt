The company seeks to foster holistic development wherever it operates. Fostering 
rural prosperity is part of its mission and the company, therefore, runs an array of CSR 
programmes. The programmes link material topics to strategic levers to align the core 
business objective of creating shareholder value, employee value, customer value and

them effectively.
