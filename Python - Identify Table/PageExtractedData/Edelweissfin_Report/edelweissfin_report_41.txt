rIl’s materiality assessment process and matrix optimises esg with stakeholder value
RIL has identified material topics through a structured ‘materiality assessment’ exercise. The 
materiality assessment is a mechanism to seek inputs from various stakeholders through 
continued interactions for decision-making. It is a three-step approach involving: 
1)  Identification of material topics based on global material issues and peer group 
benchmarking, which is married to risks and opportunities at the organisational level; 
2)   assessment of material topics; and 3) their prioritisation. RIL thus developed a 
Materiality Matrix report, which marries stakeholder assessment and decision-making 
with economic, environmental and social impact.
