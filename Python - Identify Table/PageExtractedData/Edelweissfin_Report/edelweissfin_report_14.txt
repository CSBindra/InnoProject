Seeking Growth – The ESG Way

esg’s place on investment horizon 
 While ESG has been variously defined, described and tagged, where exactly is it positioned 
in the world of investing, and how does it compare with other more traditional forms of 
investing? We argue ESG investing is not straight-jacketed, and it is a continuum. And we 
do believe its definition will continue to evolve. 
 We also believe it will be differently defined, and positioned, by the investing community. 
This will effectively mean that ESG investing will be categorised into a mix of investment 
purpose, economic returns, social good and influence, i.e. the balance between financial 
and non-financial asks. These definitions and measures will also be graded, rather than 
being binary. In effect, ESG will continue to be widely defined, leaving it subject to 
interpretation and vast in scope. It will also differ based on the perspective it’s looked from: 
the business, investor or regulator. 
Halfway house
 One way of plotting ESG on the investment spectrum is to place it between a purely 
financial returns-based approach and a decidedly philanthropic perspective. The scope 
for ESG investing falls in between these poles: balancing returns and impact, with some 
convergence, whichever end you might approach it from. This approach also suggests that 
ESG investing typically moves from a predominantly profit-only motive towards one that is 
initially more responsible and more sustainable. This is where investing the ESG Way finally 
settles and creates value. The investing spectrum eventually moves to impact and then 
philanthropic investing, where financial returns fall beyond the purview of ESG investing.
