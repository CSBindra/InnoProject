Seeking Growth – The ESG Way

Asia lags
 Asia makes up the tail with only a miniscule share of ESG assets. This probably reflects the 
nascent state of its capital markets and relatively hard focus on growth and opportunities 
in respective economies. Or it may have been broader ESG challenges in Asian markets, 
which diminish the attractiveness of such investment. It should, however, also suggest a 
tipping point in ESG investing may not be far away in Asia as the market awakens to such 
shifts and changing investor needs.

esg investing in India: nascent; global investors dominate
 It’s still early days for ESG investing in India. There is one large, and only somewhat 
prominent, domestic ESG fund. We believe there is another on the anvil, but that is likely 
to be more focussed on global pools of capital. This would change in our view, albeit the 
start and getting the momentum going is typically the most challenging phase, and this is 
where domestic ESG assets are currently positioned.
 Nevertheless, ESG funds have not shied away from investing in India. According to the 
GSIA, as many as 41 Global E&S seeking funds (aggregating USD 15 billion) have invested 
on an average 25% of their funds in Indian equities. 95 global socially responsible funds 
have invested in India and allocated on an average 18.5% to Indian companies (their 
total fund corpus is USD 25 billion). This is sizeable, and reflects the hectic activity among 
these funds. And that assets mandated under the ESG umbrella are likely to spike in India 
seems to be a foregone conclusion.
