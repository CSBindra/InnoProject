ESG investing is big. Assets mandated globally under SRI strategies jumped from 
USD 11 trillion in 2012 to USD 23 trillion in 2016. Tracking the trend, SRI assets in India 
more than doubled to about USD 30 billion from USD 13 billion over the period. Globally, 
SRI accounts for about one-fifth of capital under management*. While there could 
be definitional variances (ESG, SRI, Sustainable Investing among others), broadly 
defined ESG investing is already very large and among the fastest-growing investment 
segments globally.

  Over the past decade, sustainability has emerged as a crucial aspect of investing. 
This is evident from the exponential rise in publicly available information as well as 
signatories to the United Nations' Principles of Responsible Investing (PRI). The rising 
number of ESG equity indices across major stock exchanges is only reflective of this 
expansion. In fact, leading European investment firm Schroders states that it is now 
standard for institutional asset owners to ask about asset managers’ credentials in 
integrating ESG considerations in the investment process. The firm further states that 
retail investors have also shown appetite for products that recognise and reflect the 
relationship between their investments and an increasingly challenging social and 
environmental backdrop.
