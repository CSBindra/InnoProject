   Oil marketing companies, in particular, have been at the forefront of executing 
this scheme, not just because it is government mandated, but for the improved 
economics (and better financial health) it promises. The scheme leverages 
digital payments established by Aadhaar identification and is one of the 
prime examples of financial inclusion. It has nearly doubled LPG connections 
in the country to 240 million households, saves the government a neat 
USD 6.3 billion every year, and is at the forefront of environmental, health and 
social gains.

  India’s mixed record
   Daunting corporate governance challenges – with some prominent ones 
recently – are a clarion call for stringent governance norms, including board 
independence, stronger audit committees and stricter disclosure norms. For

and the US is dismally low. That said, we expect this aberration to continue 
to correct given Indian companies’ newfound realisation about corporate 
governance, which is driving greater transparency and overall better 
governance.
