Stepping on the gas: Licenses for new CGD geographies being rolled out rapidly
 greenhouse gas emissions in India trending down
  Government regulations and awakening towards sustainable development among 
bellwethers of corporate India have clamped down GHG and CO2 gas emissions 
of Indian companies over the past decade. The regulatory push towards curbing 
emissions is being powered by Bharat Stage VI emission standards, the National 
Air Quality Index, and introduction of FAME II Scheme for EV, which together pave 
a pathway for India’s future devoid of harmful greenhouse gases. That emission 
improvements are now visible on a sustainable basis, reflect tightening policy and 
implementation, and a corporate shift towards the same.
