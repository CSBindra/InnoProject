Female labour force participation rate: India’s gender divide striking (2017)
   Given the scale and complexity of the issue, the government must lead 
from the front to facilitate greater female participation across businesses—

female LFPR would widen the pool of labour, now untapped for centuries! A

participation in India rose, albeit marginally, across elementary occupations,
