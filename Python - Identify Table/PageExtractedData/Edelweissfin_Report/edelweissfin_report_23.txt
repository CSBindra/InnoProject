  the csr push in India
   India promulgated a landmark CSR law in 2014. It changed the landscape and 
approach to social support that businesses provide. The law stipulates that 
companies of a particular scale and profitability must spend 2% of average 
profits for preceding three years towards a wider defined set of social activities 
and objectives. The law further specifies that CSR initiatives must be run under 
the direct supervision of a board committee. 
   While the law seeks to sustainably funnel a sizeable corpus towards social 
funding, it has – importantly and most likely inadvertently – made such 
spends centre stage for corporate CEOs and brought in significant attention 
and focus to the task. Programmes pertaining to women empowerment, girl 
child, education, etc have thus spawned across corporate India and are run 
either independently or under the guidance of reputed non-governmental 
organisations. We understand funding for CSR initiatives is significant and 
should fundamentally grow ahead of India corporate sector profitability as 
businesses increasingly toe the statutory line and growing companies fall into 
the ambit of CSR framework.       
   The actual CSR spend moved up progressively to almost INR 90 billion in 2018 
and is rising. In addition, businesses are increasingly meeting their minimum 
requirements, up from 75% to 92% over the last three years. While there is still 
a gap, it’s only moderate 8%, and is typically on account of glitches and 
execution issues rather than intent. The corporate sector always did have social 
initiatives and commitments, but CSR has boosted and widened these spends, 
and in many ways coalesced and quantified them.
