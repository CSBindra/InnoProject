It is interesting that strategic decision-making at the Mahindra Group pre-emptively takes 
into consideration stakeholder concerns, thoughts, attitudes and ideas towards social, 
environment and economic issues. The importance of involving shareholders at this stage 
instils a sense of trust and belonging, and finds relevance in the larger scheme of things. 
Periodic evaluations of such material concerns, and marrying them with business processes 
helps in shaping the company’s future course of action inclusively and efficiently.
