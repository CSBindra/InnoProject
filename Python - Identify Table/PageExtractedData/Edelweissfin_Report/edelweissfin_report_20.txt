Seeking Growth – The ESG Way

 b)  India lags global standards. In spite of hectic activity in corporate boardrooms 
for an urgent need to develop businesses sustainably, India by far lags on 
the Environment and Governance parameters. And being a signatory to the 
Paris Treaty and the COP21 Conference, India must abide by the stringent 
environmental targets it has set for itself. This may look overly optimistic 
currently, but we contend India is catching up fast and should close out the 
gaps in Environment score vis-à-vis global peers—including Europe, which 
fares the best on ESG. On the country’s Governance quotient, we believe many 
subtle but far-reaching revisions to the Companies Act and stricter board norms 
have raised the bar and that eventually corporate India’s track record should not 
fall far behind.

  notoriously high pollution ails India…
   Environment is palpably India’s weakest link – in standards, impact and the 
seriousness with which it is taken at the government, business and monitoring 
levels. A case in point is the alarming air pollution in the country—vehicle 
emissions alone account for about one-fourth. According to the World Trade 
Organisation, capital New Delhi ranks a notorious 6th among the most polluted 
cities of the world with an annual mean PM2.5 reading of 143ug/m3. The WTO 
pegs this health hazard equivalent to smoking about ten cigarettes a day.
