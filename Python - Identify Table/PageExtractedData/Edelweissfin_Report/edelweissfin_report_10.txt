 How long have ESG investments been in place? A glance at the launch timeline of ESG 
indices globally clearly suggests that the US and Europe have been at the forefront. For 
instance, ESG indices in the US were launched in early 1990s—MSCI KLD 400 Social Index 
in 1990 and several thereafter over the next 15 years. In India, ESG indices debuted only 
recently in 2012. Five additional indices have been launched since, which suggests the 
groundwork and the institutional framework for more rapid growth for this asset class is 
in place.
