Seeking Growth – The ESG Way
Edelweiss Securities Limited44
In contrast to the environmental-related norms and incentives, the social cause has zoomed 
into focus only over the last decade. From mandatory priority sector lending requirements, 
minimum CSR expenditure to a slew of initiatives for financial inclusion, affordable housing 
and medical insurance, to name a few, the government has been very active on the social 
front.  It is mandating, cajoling and incentivising the private sector to play a more proactive 
social enhancement role.

Proactive role in enhancing societal well-being 
On the governance front, practices and disclosures have improved over time, plugging 
loopholes, grey areas of dispute and potential conflicts of interest. The outcomes of various 
committees, namely the Kumar Mangalam Birla Committee, NR Narayan Murthy Committee 
and the Kotak Committee have been instrumental in tightening regulatory requirements 
towards greater business transparency in general and for the board proceedings in 
particular. That has not stopped meaningful gaps from emerging, but a sustained trend 
towards higher transparency and governance standards is clear.
