Globally, reporting requirements and frameworks – particularly for companies – have 
been evolving. Basic guidelines to limit pollution and appease stakeholder needs were laid 
down in 1990s. The key among them, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 
Standards were formulated way back in 1997. Today, more than 90% of the world’s largest 
250 corporations report sustainability performance. 
The vanguard of corporate India too is actively adopting ESG-based business strategies. 
A case in point is standalone and weighty sustainability reports (up to 100 pages in some 
cases) published by leading corporates. Our interviews of other leading companies also 
corroborate that chairpersons and CEOs are increasingly devoting a disproportionately 
higher amount of time and energy "Seeking Growth – The ESG Way".
