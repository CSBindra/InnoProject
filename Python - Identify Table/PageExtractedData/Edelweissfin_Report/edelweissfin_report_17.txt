But are these SDGs only a response to more challenging times for the world at large, and 
only a defensive response to things getting tougher, for people at large? That’s debatable. 
There is a growing view that the world has, across a range of parameters, actually changed 
pretty fast and sustainably over the last few decades. The idea is forcefully argued by 
Hans Rosling in his provocative book Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the 
World – and Why Things are Better Than You Think. The author points out that, the extent 
and pace of improvement across most social and gender parameters is unprecedented. 
We therefore contend that SDGs are really an effort to raise the quality of life across the 
planet, limit the risks to environment, and support a more equitable socioeconomic system.
