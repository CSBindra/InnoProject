Future-proofing businesses as ESG narrows operating landscape
responsible stewardship focuses on building a framework of policies and technical and 
management standards that are aligned with international norms defined by organisations 
such as International Finance Corporation, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, and United Nations Global Compact, among others. Integration of these 
standards into the business processes and systems will enable the Group to excel across 
the major triple bottom-line parameters of their operations. 
stakeholder engagement involves building strong relationships with 'strategic 
stakeholders', enabling a broader and more forward-looking perspective on macro 
scenarios such as climate change, human rights and safety. This would help the Group 
anticipate trends that can have potential major impact on its business and take corrective 
or preventive action.
Future Proofing essentially implies weaving sustainability in the blueprint of strategic 
business plans of each unit to minimise risks while looking out for new or innovative 
opportunities; it therefore seeks to prime the pump for the group at large to deal with the 
rapidly changing business environment as far as 2030 or 2050.
