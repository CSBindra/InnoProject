  We observe interesting trends in the evolution of global ESG indices. The initial ones 
were broad-based with focus on ‘Environmental’ issues. Unsurprisingly the ‘negative 
screening or exclusionary’ ESG strategy was more popular then. The recent ESG index 
launches in the US and Europe are based on specific social or governance themes or 
impact investing. Thematic ESG indices show that the two geographies are ahead 
of the curve, also indicating an investment shift away from broad-based indices. 
India, currently in the nascent phase of ESG investing, understandably shows a skew 
towards broad-based ESG indices.
