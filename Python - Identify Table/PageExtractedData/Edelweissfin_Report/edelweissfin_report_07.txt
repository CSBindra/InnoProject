 surge in esg investments
  ESG assets and funds have accelerated since 2015 in the wake of growing demand 
for such strategies. According to a Bloomberg Intelligence study, ESG asset growth 
accelerated to 37% in 2017, outpacing the 23% uptick in assets under the MSCI World 
Index. Similarly, the number of funds created in 2017 were twice that of 2014. While 
ESG investing is relatively niche today, it is progressively getting mainstream.

ESG asset growth accelerates to 37% in 2017
 Where esg assets reside — europe leads
  ESG investing is very large, and the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) 
suggests assets worth USD 23 trillion were managed under ‘responsible investment 
strategies’ globally in 2016—a spike of 25% vis-à-vis 2014. India's share in this is a 
miniscule 0.1%. But where have these assets originated globally, and what are its 
geographic and growth trends? Europe is the pioneer of ESG consciousness and 
investing, and the dominant driver of perky growth in ESG investing. Even today, 
more than 50% of its investments are ESG-sensitive or benchmarked, and well ahead 
of comparable geographies. 
  That said, ESG investing is catching on in other major geographies of the world 
with the share of ESG-sensitive funds taking off over the last few years. Australia/
New Zealand have about 50% of assets under the ESG umbrella and Canada over 
a third. The US has been a relative underperformer so far with less than a quarter of 
ESG-tagged assets. It is, however, catching up and could well make the most rapid 
strides in such investing in the years ahead.
