esg – tHe IndIA eXPerIence
So how does India stack up against ESG benchmarks? Our bottom-up analysis of India’s 
NIFTY 50 companies shows that ESG initiatives as well as disclosures have shot up, but still 
lag global standards. The tightening reporting standards uncover serious ESG shortfalls 
at several leading corporates—a grim reminder that major ESG disasters in the recent 
past are not freak or one-off accidents, but gaps in business models, and that more 
accidents are waiting to happen. We see these gaps, at the country level, narrowing. The 
ESG gaps and standards vis-a-vis developed markets are also narrowing, but remain too 
large for comfort and calls for accelerating India’s ESG quotient if it is to close out these 
gaps in the medium term. 
1) A Bottom-up Aggregation: India’s rising esg scores
 a)  esg disclosures steadily rising. The Social disclosure levels more than 
doubled from 2010 through 2017; in fact, India dramatically outscores USA on 
Social disclosures. The country’s Environmental score too has improved over 
the years and is set to improve further amid rising awareness. While regulatory 
push and the government’s pull (read ‘incentives’) are marshalling companies 
into compliance with ESG standards, corporate India’s newfound willingness to 
adopt cleaner business processes too is an encouraging dynamic pushing up 
compliance.
