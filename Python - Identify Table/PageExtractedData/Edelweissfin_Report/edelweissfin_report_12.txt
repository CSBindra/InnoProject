A snapshot of ESG indices: Broad-based versus specific theme/impact-based 
c. esg investment strategies – traditional exclusionary dominates
  Investors typically classify ESG-based strategies into seven pockets, out of which 
negative screening/exclusion currently dominates. Negative screening involves 
exclusion of certain sectors or companies or practices based on specific ESG 
criteria prohibiting investments in businesses such as tobacco, liquor, mining and 
defence. That said, we spot a gradual but discernible shift from negative screening 
to progressive preference for positive and actively managed ESG funds. The launch 
of varied theme-based ESG indices and benchmarks shows that ESG investing 
is becoming nuanced and sophisticated.
