case study III:  Aditya Birla group – “think about tomorrow, today!”
The Aditya Birla Group embarked on the path of sustainability relatively late in 2012, but 
with a comprehensive roadmap and a clear intent to shape up sustainable businesses. 
Chairperson Mr K M Birla defined the Aditya Birla Group Sustainability Vision and set up the 
Group Sustainability Cell with the goal of achieving the vision. The Group institutionalised 
a sustainability framework based on three strategic pillars – Responsible Stewardship, 
Stakeholder Engagement and Future Proofing – that each of its businesses must embrace, 
embed and execute.

The Aditya Birla Group Sustainability Vision
The framework evolved into the Aditya Birla Group Sustainability Model, which summarises 
the need for sustaining growth as: “A sustainable business is one that can thrive within 
the needs and constraints of a sustainable world. A business that can reduce its impact 
on externalities...as well as one that can adapt to external factors that are driven by global 
megatrends that will inevitably affect it.” In 2017, the Group mapped the UNO’s SDGs to 
three key levers of its Sustainable Operational Excellence (SOE) strategy, namely People, 
Product and Process.
