To its credit, the Government of India has formulated many regulations and offers great 
incentives for promoting environmental, social and governance standards. To be precise, 
on the one hand, there are a myriad of incentives and subsidies in the form of business 
opportunities to embrace environment friendly businesses and practices. On the other 
hand, the government enforced stricter regulations and norms to drive home its intent on 
the matter. The number of such mandatory government regulations and incentives throw 
ample light on the broad scope of ESG in India.
Ranging from the Bharat Stage VI Standards (pollution emissions) to the Namami Gange 
Project, the Government of India has been introducing schemes, regulations and incentives 
to preserve the environment. The two-pronged countervailing approach comprises 
regulatory norms for curbing hazardous business practices with severe penalties for non-
compliance and incentives for promoting environment-friendly businesses.
