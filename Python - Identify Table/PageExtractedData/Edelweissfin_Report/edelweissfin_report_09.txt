  India’s share in global investing is a relatively modest proportion—a 7–8% benchmark 
for emerging markets and about 1% for global pools. India’s share of investments in 
global ESG funds is, however, higher, and accounts for 19% of such funds. It would 
aggregate about USD 25 billion in ESG-benchmarked equity investments. This is a 
little under 7% of the total foreign institutional equity investment in India. We contend 
this is not insignificant, and suggests ESG-benchmarked investing is gaining ground 
in India, but not appreciated adequately by businesses and the investing community 
at large. While we expect global investors to continue to get more ESG-sensitive, it is 
possibly the domestic Indian investor that could see the more sizeable shifts towards 
such an investment approach, not to mention expansion in ESG-themed asset-raising.

 sufficient evidence of superior returns at lower risk 
  Several empirical studies indicate that investors and markets reward companies that 
score highly on ESG parameters. For instance, MSCI ESG Indices for India and overseas 
have consistently outperformed their respective broader benchmarks delivering 
superior risk-adjusted returns. Similarly, we note that ESG-focused companies not 
only command valuation premiums, but portfolios comprising strong ESG companies 
have sustainably outperformed non-ESG portfolios, generating greater risk-adjusted 
returns and showing lower drawdown risks. In fact, most well-known global MSCI ESG 
indices have outperformed their respective broader country indices over periods of 
three–five-years.
