Proportion of women directors has doubled in India, but still half of global standards
  Women participation in labour force in India too falls behind
   Gender divide is stark in India due to cultural and historical reasons, but 
nowhere so much as in terms of female labour force participate rate (LFPR): 
27% in India vis-à-vis countries such as Cambodia that have a female LFPR as 
high as 81%. Even smaller neighbouring economies Bangladesh and Sri Lanka 
outclass India on female LFPR. All of this indicates the need to awaken societal 
consciousness, particularly in remote areas where female participation in labour 
force is discouraged to avoid social stigma.
