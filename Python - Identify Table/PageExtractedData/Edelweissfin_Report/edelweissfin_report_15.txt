Another perspective on ESG investing is the trade-offs and its stages. This suggests that the 
first move to ESG investing entails certain costs and trade-offs. But as one progresses along 
the spectrum to intermediate stages, there are in effect no real costs. Further headway 
down the ESG Way of doing business eventually enhances financial returns. This investment 
approach focuses on a tightly-defined ESG scale.

Our approach to the ESG Way, by definition, allows that it is more comprehensive than 
some of these approaches suggest. This will allow investors and businesses to approach 
ESG in a more broad-based way, and effectively widen the business, and some of their 
components, that will allows investors to convincingly treat them as ESG opportunities, 
and will be more inclusionary than exclusionary.
