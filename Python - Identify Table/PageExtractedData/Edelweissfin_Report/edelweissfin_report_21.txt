  We therefore, believe Environment is also where regulation will shift the most and 
implementation cost on business will be the highest (but benefits will be most 
quantifiable). That some of these challenges are not necessarily driven by scale and 
organised business (i.e. small businesses, agricultural practices) makes it politically 
tougher to tackle them, more so through legislation, and will raise the risk for and 
need of large businesses to overcompensate.  
  …but heave a sigh of relief
  The Indian government has taken note and is expediting the rollout of city gas 
distribution (CGD) to new geographies—one of its several initiatives to remedy the 
worsening pollution levels. To be precise, the number of geographies for CGD licensing 
has doubled over four years through 2018. In 2015, the government announced the 
country would leapfrog from Bharat Stage IV emission norms for vehicles to Bharat 
Stage VI by 2020—a laudable move in our opinion. Such initiatives would notably 
curtail pollution levels in a few years.
