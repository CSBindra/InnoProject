ESG index constituents: Many in broad-based, fewer in theme-based
styles of sustainable investment
The GSIA defines sustainable investing as an approach that relies on ESG screening 
in portfolio selection. This is now accepted as the global standard of classification in 
sustainable investing and is classified into:
1.  negative/exclusionary screening: It involves steering clear of sectors, companies 
or practices based on certain ESG criteria, e.g. refraining from investments in 
tobacco and liquor companies. 
2.  Positive/best-in-class screening: It advocates investments in sectors, companies 
or projects with positive ESG performance, e.g. ones with track records of enhancing 
stakeholder value via periodic ESG disclosures.
3.  norms-based screening: Screens investments based on minimal standards of 
business practices, much like negative screening, but strikes out ones that do not 
comply with norms such as the Koyoto Protocol.
4.  esg integration: Systematic and explicit inclusion of environmental, social and 
governance factors into financial analysis by investment managers. 
5.  sustainability themed investing: Investment in specific themes or assets 
related to sustainability such as clean energy, green technology and sustainable 
agriculture.
6.  Impact/community investing: Aimed at solving social or environmental 
problems by directing capital towards underserved individuals or communities, 
and is typically seen in private markets.
7.  corporate engagement and shareholder action: This approach favours 
companies whose strategies are susceptible to investor activism via direct 
corporate engagement, proxy voting based on ESG guidelines, etc.
