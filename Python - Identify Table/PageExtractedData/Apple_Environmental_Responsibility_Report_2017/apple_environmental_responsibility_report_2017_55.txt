Client: Apple Inc. 1 
Review Statement 
Corporate Fiber Footprint 
Fraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple’s corporate fiber footprint data related to corporate fiber 
usage from products, corporate, and retail operations in fiscal year 2016.  
 
1 Summary 
This review checks transparency of data and calculations, appropriateness of supporting 
product and packaging related data and assumptions, and overall plausibility of the 
calculated corporate annual fiber footprint of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2016 
and of corporate and retail operations in the same period.  
As there is no standardised method available for calculating a product or company fiber 
footprint Apple defined a methodology for internal use. The scope of the Fiber Footprint 
includes Apple’s corporate fiber usage from products, corporate, and retail operations. The 
fiber footprint tracks the total amount of wood fiber, both virgin and recycled, that Apple 
uses in packaging, and other paper products. Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific 
data for each product line and sums up these figures for the entire company using sell-in 
numbers. The output is a total fiber footprint.  
The review of the corporate annual fiber footprint has considered the following criteria: 
 The system boundaries are clearly defined 
 Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate 
 Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately 
disclosed 
Data reported by Apple is as follows: 
 Total Fiber Virgin Fiber Recycled Fiber 
2016 131,151 50,210 80,941 
[metric tons fiber] [metric tons fiber] [metric tons fiber] 
 
All results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2016 are plausible.
