13Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2017 Progress Report, Covering FY2016
The cleanest energy is the energy you never use. 
We’ve made energy efficiency a priority across all of our facilities,  
seeing energy savings of 25 percent or more in the buildings assessed. 
We have conducted extensive energy efficiency projects at our corporate 
headquarters in Cupertino, California, and the surrounding Santa Clara 
Valley where we operate more than 180 buildings. We’ve done the same  
at other campuses with high energy use—such as Elk Grove and Austin. 
As buildings age and our working needs change, we’ve undertaken 
aggressive programs to improve the comfort and function of our facilities, 
while ensuring they require less energy.
From efficiency improvements made over the past six years, in fiscal 
year 2016 we saved 55 million kilowatt-hours of energy—equivalent to 
the electricity needed to power 4500 homes for a year. The efficiency 
improvements include upgrading to LED lighting, retro-commissioning 
building controls, and upgrading heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning 
systems. When designing new buildings, we optimize energy through use 
of high-efficiency lighting and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning  
systems and through careful selection of windows, insulation, shading, 
and roofing materials to reduce heating and air-conditioning loads.
We’re lessening our impact when we commute or hit  
the road. 
Even as we shrink the carbon footprint of Apple’s facilities, we’re 
continuing to look for ways to reduce carbon emissions from business 
fleet vehicles, employees’ commute, and business travel. Those emissions 
grew by 8 percent in fiscal year 2016, primarily because our employee 
count increased by 15 percent in the same period. However, emissions 
from air travel and rental car mileage decreased despite our growth, 
reflecting an emphasis on only business-critical travel. We also offer 
our U.S. employees a transit subsidy of up to $100 per month, and at 
our Cupertino and surrounding Santa Clara Valley campus, we offer free 
coach buses to commute to and from our corporate offices. In fiscal year 
2016, use of these coach buses increased by 4 percent. When Apple Park 
opens, we will add 700 new electric vehicle charging ports, over 1000 new 
campus bicycles, and a dedicated transit center.
