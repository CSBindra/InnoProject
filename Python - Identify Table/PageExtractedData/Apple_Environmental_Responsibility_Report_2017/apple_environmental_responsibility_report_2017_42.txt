Newark, California
Our data center in Newark, California, is powered by 100 percent  
renewable energy. We hit this milestone in January 2013, when we began 
serving the data center with energy sourced primarily from California wind 
power. We’re acquiring this energy directly from the wholesale market 
through California’s Direct Access program. Late in 2017, when we antici-
pate the 130-megawatt California Flats solar project in Monterey County, 
California, to come online, we’ll use Direct Access to supply power from 
that project directly to our data center as well as other Apple facilities in 
California.

Prineville, Oregon
To support our Prineville data center, we recently signed a 200-megawatt 
power purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the Montague 
Wind Power Project, set to come online by the end of 2018. This is our 
first Apple-created wind project. And it’s our largest project to date,  
producing over 560 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy 
a year. Additionally, we executed a power purchase agreement for the 
56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II PV array located just a few miles from 
our data center. The project comes online at the end of this year and 
will produce 140 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy a year. To
