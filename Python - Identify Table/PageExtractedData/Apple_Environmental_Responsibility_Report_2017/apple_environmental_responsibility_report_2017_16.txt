Finite Resources 
Our goal is a closed-loop supply chain.
Traditional supply chains are linear. Materials are mined, manufactured as 
products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts 
over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products. 
We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where 
products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material. 
We already have programs in place to ensure the finite materials we use 
in our products are sourced responsibly through strict standards and 
programs on the ground that drive positive change. We’re also challenging 
ourselves to one day end our reliance on mining altogether. To start, we’re 
encouraging more customers to recycle their old devices through Apple 
Renew. And we’re piloting innovative new recycling techniques, like our 
line of disassembly robots, so we can put reclaimed materials to better 
use in new products. It’s an ambitious goal that will require many years 
of collaboration across multiple Apple teams, our suppliers, and specialty 
recyclers—but our work is already under way.

In the future, can we make 
products without taking finite 
resources from the earth?
