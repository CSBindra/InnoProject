strengthen the connection between Apple and these projects, we use 
Oregon’s Direct Access program to schedule the renewable energy from 
these projects directly to our data center.
Also supporting the data center are two micro-hydro projects that  
harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals that 
have been operating for over 60 years. These micro-hydro projects  
generate 12 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy a year.
Supplementing these projects, and ensuring we remain 100 percent 
renewable all the time, we executed a long-term purchase agreement 
for all environmental attributes with Cypress Creek Renewables from a 
50-megawatt portfolio of six solar arrays in Oregon.

Actual fiscal year 2016 energy data
Reno, Nevada
Unlike competitive energy markets where we’ve located some of our data 
centers, the regulated electricity supply in Nevada did not offer a simple 
solution for us to create new renewable energy projects dedicated to our 
data center. So we created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, 
to develop our first renewable project: the Fort Churchill Solar PV project. 
Apple designed, financed, and constructed the project, and NV Energy 
operates it and directs all the renewable energy it produces to our data 
center. The Fort Churchill Solar PV project uses a new kind of photovoltaic 
panel with curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The 20-megawatt 
array has an annual production capacity of over 43 million kilowatt-hours 
of clean, renewable energy. 
To facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple worked  
with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to create a green  
energy option open to all commercial customers that does not require  
the customer to fund project development up front. Thanks to this new 
option, in late 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar array, a 
50-megawatt project called Boulder II that came online in December 
2016. We’re proud that another Nevada data center operator has also 
used the new green energy option, twice.
