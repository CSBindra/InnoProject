Since 2008, we’ve reduced the average energy consumed 
by Apple products by 70 percent.?
MacBook Pro consumes 15 percent less energy than the previous 
MacBook Pro models. iMac consumes 97 percent less energy in sleep 
mode than the first generation. Mac mini consumes 40 percent less 
power when idle than the previous generation. And you can charge your 
iPhone 7 once a day for a year for only 61 cents.? These advancements  
are bringing down our overall carbon footprint and your electricity bill at 
the same time.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Product Transportation and Recycling
We’re taking responsibility for shipping 
and recycling.
We include all the energy used for shipping and recycling in our carbon 
footprint. So we make our devices lighter and our packaging smaller to 
consume less fuel when they’re transported by air and sea. Because it’s 
better for the environment, we ship by sea as often as we can. We’re also 
adjusting our recycling practices. When collecting end of life products, 
we maximize the environmental benefits of recycling by weighing the 
availability of local recovery technology with the impacts of shipping 
waste. When we have to ship recycled materials, we do it responsibly. 
And nothing is discarded unsafely.
