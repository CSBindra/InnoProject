WWF has also secured commitments from eight forestry companies, 
representing over 450,000 acres, to improve their forest management 
practices. These companies are located in seven provinces of southern 
China? that are at the heart of the commercial timber production 
area in China. Their experiences will not only benefit their own forest 
management, but also inform the development of a Best Practices 
Guideline, which is designed to influence other forest managers 
throughout the country. 
Our ambition is to shift the dynamics of the world’s paper market in both 
the short and long term, and in the process protect some of the world’s 
most important forests.
