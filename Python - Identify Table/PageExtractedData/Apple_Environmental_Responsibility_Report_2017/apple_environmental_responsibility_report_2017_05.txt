96%
Of the electricity that powers our 
global facilities, 96 percent comes 
from renewable sources.

Climate Change
How can we lead the fight against  
climate change?
We mapped our carbon footprint,  
and we’re working to eliminate it.
When we measure our carbon footprint, we include hundreds of 
suppliers, millions of customers, and hundreds of millions of devices. 
And we’re always looking for ways to make the biggest difference in 
five major areas: manufacturing, product use, facilities, transportation, 
and recycling. 
To reduce our carbon footprint, we design each generation of our 
products to be as energy efficient as possible. We’re sourcing lower-
carbon materials to make our devices, we’re partnering with suppliers  
to add clean energy to their facilities, and we produce and procure  
clean, renewable energy for 96 percent of the electricity used at our 
global facilities.
In 2016, our comprehensive carbon footprint was 29.5 million metric 
tons, compared with 38.4 million the year before. A variety of factors 
contributed to the 23 percent decline, including benefits of our 
environmental programs (such as reduced emissions from aluminum 
manufacturing and installing clean energy in our supply chain), a  
year-over-year decline in the total number of products sold, and changes 
to our carbon footprint calculations. Every year we refine our product 
life cycle analysis, moving from industry-average data to more Apple-
specific data whenever possible, and in 2016 we developed more detailed 
information about the carbon intensity of the integrated circuits we use. 
Without the methodology changes, our carbon footprint would have 
declined by 10 percent.

We’ve decreased carbon emissions per  
product every  year since 2011.
