Renewable Resources 
When we use renewable resources,  
we make sure to use them responsibly.
The earth’s most precious resources, like water and paper, are renewable 
if they’re managed responsibly. So we do everything we can to conserve 
them. We’re measuring our water footprint and finding ways to reduce or 
reuse water wherever possible. We’re also using paper and plastic more 
efficiently in our packaging, and tackling our zero-waste-to-landfill goals 
at our campuses and retail stores. And we’re committed to protecting and 
creating more sustainable forests than we’re using.
We hold ourselves accountable for every drop of  
water we use.
Water is essential to all life. We need it to drink, to grow our food, and to 
maintain natural ecosystems throughout the planet. And though water is 
a renewable resource, its scarcity makes it precious in many parts of the 
world. So we hold ourselves accountable for the water we use, whether 
at our headquarters in California or in our suppliers’ facilities around the 
globe. We’re constantly seeking ways to conserve water and discharge 
wastewater safely.
At our own offices, data centers, and retail stores across the world, 
we monitor water use within our cooling, landscaping, and sanitation 
processes so we can develop targeted ways to conserve water. In fiscal 
year 2016, Apple used 630 million gallons of water, up 10 percent from  
the previous year. This increase was driven primarily by growth at our  
data centers, both from increased construction and cooling needs. We 
have also transitioned our Mesa, Arizona, facility from a corporate office  
to a data center.
Corporate water use
We calculate our corporate water use for our data centers, retail stores, and  
corporate offices.
