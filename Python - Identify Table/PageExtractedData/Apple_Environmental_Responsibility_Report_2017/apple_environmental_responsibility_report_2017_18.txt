But sourcing isn’t enough—we want to recover as much tin as we’re using 
and make sure it’s put back into the world’s supply. Unfortunately, tin is 
not recovered by all electronics recyclers. So we are working to identify tin 
recyclers and ensure that the material is being consistently recovered and 
recycled from our products. To start, we are sending iPhone 6 main logic 
boards recovered by Liam to a recycler who can reclaim the tin in addition 
to the copper and precious metals. We are now looking for ways to do this 
on a larger scale for tin—and apply what we’ve learned to other materials. 
For example, we’re experimenting with ways to recover cobalt from our 
lithium-ion batteries and use recycled cobalt.
Throughout this process, we’re learning a lot about how to create closed-
loop supply chains. For some materials, sourcing recycled content will be 
sufficient as long as we ensure the same amount is recovered, recycled, 
and put back on the market. Where recycled content isn’t available at 
the desired quality, we can drive improvements in recycling technologies 
and a tighter closed loop—such as using material from old Apple devices 
to build new ones. And when there are materials for which recycling 
technologies don’t yet exist, we’ll need to invest in research and other 
technology solutions.
For every 100,000 iPhone 6 
devices, Liam has the potential 
to recover the following  
materials:
Aluminum (1900 kg) 
Copper (800 kg) 
Gold (0.3 kg) 
Platinum Group Metals (0.4 kg) 
Silver (7 kg) 
Tin (55 kg) 
Rare Earth Elements (24 kg) 
Cobalt (550 kg) 
Tungsten (3.5 kg) 
Tantalum (2.5 kg)
Liam is a line of robots that  
disassembles iPhone 6 into  
individual components, making  
it easier to recover finite  
resources such as aluminum, 
tungsten, and cobalt.
