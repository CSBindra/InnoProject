31Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2017 Progress Report, Covering FY2016
Eliminating Toxins
The worst toxins and what we’ve done 
about them.
After we identify toxins in our products, we reduce them, remove them, 
or develop new materials that are safer. These efforts also remove toxins 
from our manufacturing and recycling processes, which protects workers 
and keeps pollutants out of the land, air, and water.
Beryllium
Eliminated from all new product 
designs. Beryllium is found in copper 
alloys used to make connectors and 
springs.
Mercury
Eliminated in 2009. We use energy-
efficient, mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs 
instead of mercury-based fluorescent 
lamps in all our displays.
Lead
Phased out of display glass and  
solder in 2006.
Arsenic
Eliminated from display glass since 
2008. Arsenic was traditionally used  
in glass.
PVC and Phthalates
Replaced with safer thermoplastic  
elastomers.¹? Both are still used by  
other companies in power cords  
and headphone cables.
Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs)
Eliminated from thousands of parts  
such as enclosures, cables, circuit 
boards, and connectors in 2008.  
We use safer metal hydroxides and 
phosphorus compounds in their place.
