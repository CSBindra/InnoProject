35Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2017 Progress Report, Covering FY2016
Sharing best practices.
We believe that sharing our vision and our commitment can make a  
difference well beyond Apple’s business. To increase our impact, our 
team presented at several notable conferences, meetings, and  
events, including:
•  The Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM7) and Low Carbon Technology 
Partnerships initiative conferences, both in San Francisco, where we 
advocated for climate action by companies and stronger clean-energy 
policies by governments.
•  Electronics Goes Green conference in Berlin, where we shared our  
progress on circular economy, resource efficiency, and safer materials.
•  Ceres Conference in Boston, where we discussed the importance of 
integrating safer materials strategies into product design processes.
•  Climate Week in New York City, where we shined a spotlight on our  
work to gain renewable energy commitments from our manufacturing 
suppliers.
Advocating for strong policies.
We believe it’s important to stand alongside those who share our values 
and our passion for this work. To defend the best ideas and to amplify  
our beliefs. And to speak out when our voice will have a powerful impact.
In April 2016, Apple joined Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to sign an 
amicus brief in support of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean 
Power Plan. As leading U.S. businesses, we wanted to send a clear 
message to lawmakers that renewable energy is great for business.
In June 2016, Lisa Jackson addressed 700 senior government, business, 
and community leaders, at the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial, where 
she called for governments across the world to put a price on carbon to 
address climate change.
