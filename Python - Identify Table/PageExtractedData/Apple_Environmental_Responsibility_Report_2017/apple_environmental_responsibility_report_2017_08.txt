8Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2017 Progress Report, Covering FY2016
Our direct partners are already making a big difference. Ibiden, which 
produces integrated circuit packaging substrates, has committed to 
generating renewable energy equivalent to the energy used to make Apple 
products by the end of 2018. Ibiden will be our first supplier in Japan to make 
the switch. Its floatovoltaic project will be one of the largest floating solar 
projects in the country. Biel Crystal Manufactory Ltd. is another great example 
of leadership—it has already contracted 50 percent of its Apple energy load 
to come from wind and solar and will increase this to 100 percent in 2018. 
Other partners across our supply chain are installing or investing in sizable 
solar projects, running their factories on wind power, and purchasing clean 
energy from reputable utility programs. 
The transition to renewable energy can be highly technical. It often requires 
complicated deal structures across many regions with their own regulatory 
requirements. Apple is experienced in sourcing and building renewable 
energy—quickly and at a high standard across the globe—so we are 
working alongside our suppliers to overcome many of these challenges. 
For example, in China direct power purchases for renewable energy 
are rare. Our teams sought guidance from the national government and 
stakeholders, made introductions between our suppliers and reputable 
renewable energy developers, and coordinated discussions with local 
government. Our suppliers have now entered into cost-effective renewable 
energy power purchase agreements in a number of provinces—among the 
first of their kind in China, paving the way for others to follow.
Ibiden’s floating solar project in  
Japan will help it reach its 100 percent  
renewable energy goal for Apple by 
the end of 2018.
