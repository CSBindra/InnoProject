Notes:  
— Energy source not yet online.
¹Scope 1 emissions result from natural gas use for facilities, and gasoline use for fleet vehicles. As is typical, these emissions are tracked separately from our 100 percent renewable energy claim.
²Scope 2 emissions result from electricity use for facilities. In addition, in fiscal year 2014, Apple owned a facility in Mesa, Arizona, that was operated by a supplier, which had default grid emissions of 151,279 tons  
CO2e and effective emissions of 0 tons CO2e in fiscal year 2014. It was removed from operation in fiscal year 2015.
³Default Utility Emissions are based on utility-scale and regional default grid emission factors (using the most granular data set available).
?In FY2016, we began tracking electricity used at colocation facilities as part of Apple’s footprint.
