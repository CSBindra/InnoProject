Product Durability
A durable device is a greener device.
When products can be used longer, fewer resources need to be extracted 
from the earth to make new ones. So we assess all of our products in our 
Reliability Testing Lab, using rigorous testing methods that simulate our 
customers’ real-world experiences with their devices. For example, we 
analyze how devices stand up to extreme heat and cold, exposure to water 
and everyday chemicals, and scratching tests from materials like steel wool 
and denim. In addition to industry-standard measures, we also devise our 
own tests and even build custom testing machinery. We design these tests 
based on our studies of user behavior and by analyzing returned products 
to fully understand any problems.
In the event that something does break, we have programs like AppleCare 
and Apple-certified repair services to help our customers use their 
devices longer. We also release regular free software updates that keep 
our products current and extend their lives as long as possible. And we 
design those software updates to be compatible with older generations 
of products. macOS Sierra, for example, is compatible with Mac models 
dating back to late 2009. And when customers decide to upgrade to new 
devices, the old ones often have new lives with friends or family, or in the 
refurbished market through programs like Apple Renew.
To ensure that they can stand up to 
repeated use, the keys on MacBook 
are pressed millions of times.
