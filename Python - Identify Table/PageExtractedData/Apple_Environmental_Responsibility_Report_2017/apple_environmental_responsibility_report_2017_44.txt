Solar + Geothermal
In early 2017 we again used the green energy option for our third Nevada 
solar array, a 200-megawatt project called Techren Solar—Apple‘s largest 
solar array to date. It is set to come online by the end of 2018 and is 
estimated to produce over 540 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable 
energy a year.

Actual fiscal year 2016 energy data
Mesa, Arizona
Our newest data center, our global command center in Mesa, Arizona, 
came online in 2016. To support this facility, we partnered with the local 
utility, the Salt River Project, to build the 50-megawatt Bonnybrooke solar 
array, which became operational in October 2016. This project produces 
over 147 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy a year, which 
more than fully matches the energy used by the data center.

*Apple took operational control of the building in October 2015 and converted it to a data center that began servicing customers in  
March 2017.
Viborg, Denmark
We’re currently constructing a new data center running on 100 percent 
renewable energy in Denmark’s central Jutland region. Due to its proximity 
to one of Denmark’s largest electrical substations, the data center won’t 
require back-up generators, which typically run on diesel and require 
periodic testing and burning of fuel. The facility is designed to capture 
excess heat from its equipment and conduct it into the local district 
heating system to help warm homes in the community.
