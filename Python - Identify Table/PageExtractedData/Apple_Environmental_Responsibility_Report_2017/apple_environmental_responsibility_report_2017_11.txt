Apple’s renewable energy projects (megawatts)  
 
 
 
 
 
Apple has installed 315 megawatts of Apple-owned renewable energy projects and 
projects with long-term agreements. An additional 618 megawatts of renewable energy 
projects are in construction. This does not include Apple-owned projects supporting 
the supplier clean energy program, such as the 485 megawatts of solar and wind  
projects in China.
Producing renewable energy to meet our own needs.
Burning coal, oil, or natural gas to produce electricity releases carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. So we’ve 
committed to power all our corporate offices, retail stores, and data 
centers worldwide using only renewable energy. We’re producing a lot of 
it ourselves, developing our own solar, fuel cell, water, and wind projects. 
For example, we connected 40 megawatts of new solar energy to China’s 
national grid, producing more than enough electricity for all our corporate 
offices and retail stores in China. Since 2011, these projects have reduced 
the emissions from our offices, data centers, and retail stores worldwide by 
60 percent and prevented more than 1.6 million metric tons of CO?e from 
entering the atmosphere. In 2016 alone, they reduced CO?e emissions by 
nearly 585,000 metric tons. Without renewable energy, these emissions 
would have more than tripled since 2011. We’ve also issued a $1.5 billion 
green bond, which is dedicated to financing environmental projects, 
including renewable energy initiatives at our facilities around the world.
Apple scopes 1 and 2 building emissions 
Worldwide corporate, data centers, and Apple Stores
 
Since 2011, Apple has reduced emissions from our offices, data centers, and retail 
stores worldwide by 60 percent. Without renewable energy and energy efficiency 
measures, these emissions would have increased over 200 percent since 2011.  
In fiscal year 2016, we added colocation facilities and distribution centers to our  
electricity footprint, contributing to the increase in default emissions. More detailed 
emissions data is provided in Appendix A.
In February 2017, we issued our  
first Green Bond report, covering 
fiscal year 2016.

We worked with Sunseap to source  
100 percent clean energy in Singapore 
from a first-of-its-kind project: roughly 
32 megawatts of solar panels on more 
than 800 rooftops in the city.
