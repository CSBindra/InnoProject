Client: Apple Inc. 3
? Regional distribution of sold units and country specific allocation per product to 
major sell-in countries 
? Product specific data on transportation including breakdown of air and sea 
shipment 
? Life cycle GHG emissions for all products, differentiating the actual product 
configurations (i.e. memory capacity) 
? Calculation methodology for the company carbon footprint and methodological 
changes implemented in 2016 
? The total company carbon footprint – scope 3 for the fiscal year 2016 
? Detailed analysis of the CCF including: 
o The breakdown of the CCF into life cycle phases manufacturing, 
transportation, product use and recycling 
o Detailed product specific split into life cycle phases 
o The contribution of individual products and product families to the overall 
CCF 
The data and information supporting the GHG assertion were projected (use phase and 
recycling) and historical (i.e. fiscal year 2016 data regarding sales figures, manufacturing, 
transportation). 
This review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall 
company carbon footprint. The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions: 
? Are product LCAs referenced correctly? 
? Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible? 
? Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of 
methodological changes as indicated by Apple?  
This review was done remotely. 
3 Findings 
Prior to this CCF review and verification 5 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed 
successfully against ISO 14040/44. These recent LCAs cover product segments Apple
