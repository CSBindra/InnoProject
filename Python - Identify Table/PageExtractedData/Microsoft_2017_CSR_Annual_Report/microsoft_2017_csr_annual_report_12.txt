Microsoft 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 12
Principles People Planet ResourcesOur approach
Public policy engagement During the launch of A Cloud for Global Good, Microsoft’s policy roadmap, Micro-
soft President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, articulated how we prioritize our 
CSR issues and how they connect to our business success:  
“Technology is creating new jobs, but automation can challenge and even replace 
some traditional jobs. There are new challenges to privacy rights. There are new ques-
tions about income inequality. There are new opportunities but also challenges for 
people with disabilities.” 
“If we don’t acknowledge explicitly, at the outset, that this new era creates both 
opportunity and challenge, the truth is we’ll do less than we should to make the most 
of the promise that lies ahead. We need to ensure that we move technology forward 
without leaving people behind.” 
“This requires that we accept a sense of shared responsibility. Those of us who work in 
the tech sector and the private sector have an important role and responsibility, as do 
people across civil society, and as do governments around the world.” 
To fulfill that responsibility, we need to ensure that the cloud is trusted, responsible 
and inclusive. Microsoft’s efforts include:
• Our human rights commitments, and our commitments to privacy and data security work to 
ensure that our cloud is trusted. 
• Our commitments to environmental sustainability, responsible sourcing, and empowering our 
employees to ensure that our cloud is responsible.
• Our commitments to accessibility, global diversity and inclusion, and empowering communities to 
ensure that our cloud is inclusive.
