Microsoft and the UN 
Sustainable Development 
Goals
In September 2015, the UN General Assembly agreed to 17 global Sustainable De-
velopment Goals (SDGs) to reach by 2030. The goals and specific targets under the 
goals seek to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all.
Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet 
to achieve more aligns strongly to the UN SDGs. To better understand how we and 
other information technology companies can advance the goals, Microsoft was a 
lead sponsor of a report by the Global E-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) and Accen-
ture called “#SystemTransformation.” The report found that digital technology can 
help put all the SDGs within reach by enabling a broad range of economic and 
social opportunities worldwide.
In September 2017, we produced a white paper to identify ways in which Microsoft 
contributes to the global effort to achieve the SDGs. (Read the report here.)
As we continue to advance our thinking and work to address the SDGs, we’ll update 
this page with further information.
