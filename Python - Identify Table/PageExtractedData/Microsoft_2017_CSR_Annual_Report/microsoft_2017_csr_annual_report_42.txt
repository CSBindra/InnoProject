The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provides the leading framework that corpo-

is based on input from a wide range of civil society organizations, labor groups, 
businesses, academics, and other experts.
Our 2017 CSR Report content contains standard disclosures from the GRI’s G4 Sus-
tainability Reporting Guidelines for FY17. We provide the GRI Content Index below 
to allow our stakeholders to readily find the disclosures throughout our report 
content.
