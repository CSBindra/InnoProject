Inclusive sourcing
QUICK FACTS
Walmart and Sam’s Clubs sourced more 
than $11 billion from diverse suppliers38 
in the U.S. 
According to data from our suppliers, 
approximately two-thirds of what we 
spend to buy products for Walmart 
U.S. goes toward items that are made, 
sourced or grown in the U.S.
We use the power of our purchase order as a 
development tool in two ways: to promote diverse 
suppliers and to support small producers in 
emerging markets.
Diverse sourcing
Our supplier inclusion statement, signed by 
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, highlights our belief 
that a diverse supply chain enables us to deliver 
better products and a broader selection to the 
communities we serve. 
Walmart does business with more than 2,800 
diverse suppliers39 who represent products in 
Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. In the U.S., 
Walmart and Sam’s Club sourced more than  
$11 billion from diverse suppliers in FY2019.  
Of this, $10.6 billion was for merchandising  
and $1.2 billion was for other goods and 
professional services.
We are also a member of the Billion Dollar 
Roundtable, which celebrates corporations 
that achieve spending of at least $1 billion with 
diverse businesses and adhere to the classification 
and reporting standards established by this 
organization.
Using the National Minority Supplier Development 
Council’s and Women’s Business Enterprise 
National Council’s standard diverse business 
ownership definitions as benchmarks, we track 
diversity in our supply chain under the following 
diverse classifications: Women, African Americans, 
Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native 
Americans, Native Alaskans, members of the LGBT 
community, veterans, disabled veterans and other 
people with disabilities.
