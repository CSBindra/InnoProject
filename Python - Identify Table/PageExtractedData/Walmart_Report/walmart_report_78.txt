Walmart Privacy Policy ?
Walmart Financial Services Privacy Notice ?
Sam’s Club Privacy Policy ?
We have developed a program designed to protect 
our global enterprise, which is based on the National 
Institute of Standards Framework for Improving 
Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. We have also 
established defined procedures for responding in  
the event of a breach, including when and how to 
engage with internal management, stakeholders  
and law enforcement. 
We have privacy policies in place regarding our 
treatment of customer data in both our offline 
and online U.S. Walmart and Sam’s Club retail 
environments. Our policies provide explanations 
of the types of information we collect, how we 
use and share information, and generally describe 
the measures we take to protect the security of 
that information. Our policies also describe how 
customers may initiate inquiries and raise concerns 
regarding the collection, sharing and use of their 
personal data.
