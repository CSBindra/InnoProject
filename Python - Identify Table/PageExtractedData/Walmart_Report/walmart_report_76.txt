We provide a variety of resources for our 
stakeholders to raise questions or concerns, 
including: 
• Global helpline: It is available to stakeholders 
around the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
and is equipped to handle most languages 
spoken in the retail markets where we operate. 
Reports can be made anonymously.
• Global email address: This is available for 
reporting concerns, asking questions or 
simply seeking guidance for situations which 
may be unclear. All contacts are received by 
Walmart’s Global Ethics and Compliance team 
in Bentonville, Arkansas.
• WalmartEthics.com: This website is available 
in 13 languages and is accessible globally. 
Stakeholders can ask questions, read our 
Statement of Ethics, submit ethical concerns 
and follow up on previously reported concerns.
In addition to these resources, Walmart maintains 
a global case management system that serves as 
both a repository for ethics cases and a system for 
managing them. We have a documented process 
for handling ethical concerns that promotes 
consistency across our global operations. Our 
Global Ethics team promptly reviews, analyzes 
and assigns each actionable complaint — including 
those submitted anonymously. The Global Ethics 
team also oversees the prompt and thorough 
investigation of all actionable ethics complaints.
