Waste
Our work aims to break the link between the 
growth of our business and the production of 
waste. In 2005, Walmart set an aspirational goal 
to achieve zero waste in our own operations. By 
2025, we aim to achieve that goal in Canada, 
Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.21  In 2018, we diverted 
78% of our unsold products, packaging and other 
materials from landfill and incineration globally.22 
We also work with our suppliers to reduce waste 
through Project Gigaton.
Two areas of particular focus are plastic and food 
waste. In addition to addressing plastic and food 
waste in our operations, we are working with 
suppliers upstream and building capacity with 
consumers and other organizations to eliminate 
waste downstream.
