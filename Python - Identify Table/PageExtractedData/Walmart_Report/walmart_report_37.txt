Walmart engages in advocacy and coalitions to 
promote environmental public policy that aligns  
with our shared value business objectives.  
Examples include:
• We Are Still In: To promote the aims of 
the Paris Climate Agreement after the 
announcement of the U.S. withdrawal, Walmart 
joined an initiative called We Are Still In. This 
is a signal to world leaders that Americans will 
not retreat from the global pact to reduce 
emissions and stem the causes of climate 
change.
• Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance: We are 
members of this coalition that brings together 
purchasers and suppliers of renewable energy 
to make the process of transitioning to cleaner 
energy sources easier.
• Paris and Bonn negotiations: We participated 
in the United Nations Climate Change 
Conferences in 2015 and 2017 to collaborate 
with international stakeholders in advancing 
environmental issues around the world.
• Global Forest Watch Pro: To promote 
transparency and traceability across our supply 
chains, in 2017, Walmart joined the World 
Resources Institute and 20 other companies 
to launch Global Forest Watch Pro, an online 
platform that provides companies, banks and 
other stakeholders with data and tools for 
monitoring global forest loss because of the 
production of key commodities such as palm 
oil, soy and Brazilian beef.
• Consumer Goods Forum: We are a member 
and our CEO serves on its Board of Directors. 
This organization promotes collaboration 
between consumer goods retailers and 
manufacturers to drive positive change on 
issues such as climate change and forced labor.
