20x25
20x25 means we aspire to source at least 20 key 
commodities more sustainably by 2025, across  
the following: 
• Fresh produce
• Animal agriculture
• Seafood
• Specialty commodities such as coffee,  
tea and cocoa
• Row crops
• Consumables, such as personal care products
• Apparel/textiles
We have prioritized the 20x25 commodities based 
upon a variety of factors, including the nature and 
magnitude of environmental and social improvement 
opportunities (as informed by Sustainability Index 
data and feedback from stakeholders); business 
opportunity and risk (e.g., sales, supply security, cost 
issues or reputation risk); and Walmart’s ability to 
convene suppliers and others to promote change.  
In each case, we are working with suppliers, NGOs 
and others to understand the current state and  
pursue initiatives to advance environmental and/or 
social indicators.  
The Index is one of several tools we use to help us 
make progress on 20x25. As an example, the chart 
to the right illustrates the category scorecard for 
consumables suppliers. A Walmart buyer can use this 
scorecard to identify improvement opportunities for 
individual suppliers and spotlight issues for category-
wide initiatives, such as sustainable chemistry and 
packaging design.
