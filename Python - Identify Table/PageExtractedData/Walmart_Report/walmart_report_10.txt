Our approach to environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) topics is rooted in our 
company’s purpose to save people money so they 
can live better.
Key elements of our approach
Creating shared value
Embedded in our purpose is the principle of 
shared value: We increase business value by 
helping to address important needs in society and, 
conversely, we can help transform society through 
our business. For example, better ESG practices 
can enhance customer trust, catalyze new 
product lines, increase productivity, reduce costs 
and secure future supply, while simultaneously 
improving livelihoods, advancing economic 
mobility and opportunity, reducing emissions and 
waste, and restoring natural capital.
Salient issues
We set ESG priorities based on relevance to 
our company purpose, key categories and 
markets; Walmart’s ability to create change; and 
relative importance to our customers and other 
stakeholders.
Whole-systems change 
To maximize shared value, we aim not only to run 
a good retail business, but also to make large-
scale and lasting improvements to the ecosystems 
most salient to our business. Walmart has a unique 
ability to make a difference through our strengths, 
including our approximately 2.2 million associates 
around the world, supplier relationships, jobs, 
purchase orders and expertise.
Business leadership
We drive and track performance against our 
social and environmental priorities through our 
everyday business activities. For example, we track 
performance toward our diversity goals through 
our human resources activities, and toward our 
aspirational renewable energy goals through real 
estate and operations activities. ESG initiatives 
are embedded throughout our company in our 
business planning and performance management 
cycle, operating policies, organization roles and 
coordinating mechanisms, project governance, and 
systems and tools (e.g., the Sustainability Index).
