The Walmart Board is comprised of individuals 
whom we believe collectively provide an 
appropriate balance of distinguished leadership, 
diverse perspectives, strategic skill sets and 
professional experience relevant to our business 
and strategic objectives. Our Board has five 
primary standing committees, including the 
Nominating and Governance Committee, which 
reviews and advises management on Walmart’s 
ESG initiatives. In FY2019, the Nominating and 
Governance Committee met five times.
