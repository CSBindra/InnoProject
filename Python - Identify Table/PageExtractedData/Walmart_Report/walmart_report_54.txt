Walmart’s supply chain reaches more than 
100,000 suppliers globally. In 1992, we launched 
our Responsible Sourcing program to establish 
our expectation that suppliers and their facilities 
operate responsibly, in a way that protects 
worker dignity. We set expectations through 
our Standards for Suppliers and use a risk-
based approach to monitoring our supply chain, 
focusing audits on those geographies with 
greater potential risks. 
We also collaborate with peers and other 
industry stakeholders to address human rights 
issues in complex supply chains and to improve 
the capacity of the global retail sourcing 
system. Recognizing the need for whole-system 
transformation, Walmart has committed to 
use our ability to bring together stakeholders 
including industries, civil society, governments 
and international organizations to address the 
major potential risks to the dignity of workers in 
a minimum of 10 retail supply chains by 2025.
