Sourcing responsibly
Given our size and global footprint, Walmart has a 
unique opportunity to use the power of our purchase 
orders to improve supply chain conditions. We set 
high expectations for our suppliers. Members of 
our Responsible Sourcing team around the world 
work to assess risk, monitor supply chain conditions 
through audit assessments and investigations, provide 
training and tools for suppliers, and collaborate with 
stakeholders to make progress on key industry-wide 
issues. The team also acts as a resource for fellow 
Walmart associates, providing training so that they 
can better understand and navigate potential human 
rights risks associated with various geographies 
and industries. Having our Responsible Sourcing 
associates embedded in markets around the world 
allows us to better understand regional challenges 
in our supply chains and leverage our local presence 
to build strong connections with local suppliers and 
markets. As of January 2019, we have more than 150 
Responsible Sourcing associates.
