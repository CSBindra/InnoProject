Our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) reports to 
our Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs 
and provides management direction and oversight 
of Walmart’s publicly stated global ESG initiatives 
and goals. Both executives provide regular reports 
to the Nominating and Governance Committee 
on our ESG initiatives. In addition, the CSO 
presides over a cross-functional ESG Steering 
Committee, which is a management committee 
that meets biannually and is made up of leaders 
from various departments. Experts from these 
represented departments are also part of an ESG 
Working Group that meets quarterly to develop 
management strategies, identify potential impacts 
to the business and keep the ESG Steering 
Committee informed of relevant projects  
and initiatives. 
In addition, an ESG team, which reports directly 
to the CSO, as well as others at Walmart — 
including our corporate leaders — connect with 
stakeholders through formal reviews of ESG 
priorities and on an ongoing basis to stay abreast 
of ESG issues, challenges and opportunities. 
These discussions enable us to understand 
stakeholders’ priority issues, which are detailed in 
the Stakeholders and their ESG priorities section 
of this report.
