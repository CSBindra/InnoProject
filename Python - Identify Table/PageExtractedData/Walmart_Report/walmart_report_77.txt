On June 20, 2019 Walmart announced that 
we entered into a global settlement with 
the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and 
the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) that resolves a more than seven-year 
investigation into the company’s compliance 
with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA). Additional information can be found 
in our press release. Since launching our 
internal review in 2011, Walmart has taken 
actions over the years to enhance our Global 
Anti-Corruption Program and several of these 
were recognized by the DOJ and SEC:
• Hiring dedicated home office and 
market-level anti-corruption compliance 
leadership including a Global Ethics and 
Compliance Officer, an International 
Ethics and Compliance Officer, and a 
Global Anti-Corruption Officer; 
• Enhancing the company’s Global Anti-
Corruption Training and Awareness 
Program;
• Enhancing internal controls on the 
selection and use of third-party 
intermediaries who interact with 
government officials on Walmart’s behalf; 
• Terminating business relationships with 
third parties involved in the conduct  
at issue. 
All content pertaining to the FCPA ruling was added to 
the 2019 ESG Report on July 1, 2019. As noted above, 
the ruling was announced on June 20, 2019, after the 
original ESG report was published on May 7, 2019.
