Aligned philanthropy
Our corporate giving and the Walmart 
Foundation’s programs complement our business 
initiatives by seeking to help accelerate social and 
environmental transformation. In FY2019, through 
a combination of in-kind and cash gifts, Walmart 
gave more than $1.4 billion to projects that create 
opportunity, enhance sustainability and strengthen 
communities. 
Collective action
Since we believe that collective action is essential 
to transforming systems, we shape our ESG 
programs in collaboration with other leaders 
and stakeholders. Project Gigaton, the Retail 
Opportunity Network and the Sustainability Index 
are just a few examples of large-scale, system-wide 
collaborations we have helped create.
