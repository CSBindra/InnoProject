Board diversity 
We believe that a Board comprised of directors with 
diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives 
improves dialogue and decision-making and 
contributes to overall board effectiveness. 
Among other factors, our Nominating and 
Governance Committee includes gender and racial 
diversity among the factors reviewed and considered 
in the director nomination process. We also evaluate 
our overall approach to Board diversity annually 
during the Board and Committee evaluation process. 
As of February 7, 2019, our Board included nine  
men and three women, and two of our directors  
are of racially or ethnically diverse backgrounds. 
Walmart is also a signatory to Catalyst CEO 
Champions for Change.

corporate governance topics, please visit our
