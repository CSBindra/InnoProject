With respect to climate change, we want to address 
our own operations while galvanizing collective action 
across the retail supply chain to bend the curve on 
emissions — working with suppliers in an attempt 
to avoid a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions by 
2030 through initiatives in energy, waste, agriculture, 
packaging, natural capital and product design.
In this report, you will find a summary of our 
aspirational goals and recent progress related to our 
priority ESG issues. For example, since our last report, 
we conducted our first climate risk assessment and 
have advanced toward our science-based targets 
for emissions reduction; we have launched new 
initiatives in waste reduction, particularly related 
to plastic. Inspired by the United Nations (U.N.) 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
we published our first human rights statement to 
make it easier to see how we respect human rights 
across our business. We continue to strengthen our 
retail associate proposition and make strides working 
with others toward the social and environmental 
sustainability of multiple supply chains. 
As always, we welcome your feedback and your 
collective action in helping to transform retail 
systems for long-term environmental, social and 
economic sustainability.
