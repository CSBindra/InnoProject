Human rights
As Sam Walton created the company that has 
developed into the Walmart we know today, he 
wanted to provide customers access to affordable 
products, so they could save money to live better. 
He talked about wanting to “take care of our 
associates” and support the vision customers hold 
for their communities. While Sam used his own 
words, a respect for human rights corresponds with 
the core values he instilled in our company.
Human rights statement 
For many years, our perspectives and initiatives 
that underscore our respect for human rights 
were described across a number of statements 
(e.g., Supplier Code of Conduct) and documents 
(e.g., Ethics and Compliance Report). In 
November 2018, we published Walmart’s first 
Human Rights Statement, which consolidates our 
perspectives in one place.
As part of our work to develop our Human Rights 
Statement, we convened a cross-functional Steering 
Committee as well as a Working Group who:
• Reviewed a variety of international instruments 
including, but not limited to, the United Nations 
(U.N.) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Labor Organization’s 1998 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work, and the U.N. Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights
• Reviewed stakeholder feedback from research 
and consultations 
• Obtained and incorporated feedback from 
human rights subject matter experts 
• Considered analysis of Walmart conducted 
by a number of third parties, including Shift, 
Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, Know the 
Chain and Oxfam 
• Reviewed the work of other companies, both 
those in our peer industry group and those 
that are considered leaders in human rights, to 
understand and compare their approach to ours
 Walmart’s four core values
Service to the customer 
Respect for the individual
Strive for excellence
