Our approach 
To foster diversity and inclusion within Walmart, 
we focus on recruitment, development and 
retention. We seek to develop equity in 
representation and an inclusive culture and to 
confirm our commitment to fair-pay practices. 
An important component of fostering inclusion 
is raising awareness about unconscious bias. We 
have developed unconscious bias training for 
associates across the organization. All officers 
have Inclusive Leadership Expectations as 
part of their annual performance evaluation. A 
component of these expectations is abiding by 
our Statement of Ethics, failure of which may 
result in an annual cash incentive pay reduction. 
For more information, please see our 
Culture Diversity & Inclusion (CDI) Report. 
*Diversity & inclusion numbers are calculated based upon total U.S. workforce, including associates in the U.S. regardless of whether assigned to a 
subsidiary that owns or operates an ecommerce business, platform and/or marketplace.
