Forward-looking statement
This report contains certain forward-looking 
statements based on Walmart management’s 
current assumptions and expectations, including 
statements regarding our sustainability targets, goals, 
commitments and programs and other business 
plans, initiatives and objectives. These statements 
are typically accompanied by the words “could,” 
“hope,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “aspire” or similar 
words. All such statements are intended to enjoy the 
protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking 
statements provided by the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Our 
actual future results, including the achievement 
of our targets, goals or commitments, could differ 
materially from our projected results as the result 
of changes in circumstances, assumptions not being 
realized, or other risks, uncertainties and factors. 
Such risks, uncertainties and factors include the 
risk factors discussed in Item 1A of our most recent 
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as well as, with 
respect to our sustainability targets, goals, and 
commitments outlined in this report or elsewhere, 
the challenges and assumptions identified in this 
report under the heading Challenges to achieving 
aspirational goals, commitments & targets and other 
assumptions, risks, uncertainties and factors identified 
in this report. You should consider the forward-
looking statements in this report in conjunction with 
our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent 
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports 
on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Walmart urges you 
to consider all of the risks, uncertainties and factors 
identified above or discussed in such reports carefully 
in evaluating the forward-looking statements in 
this report. Walmart cannot assure you that the 
results reflected or implied by any forward-looking 
statement will be realized or, even if substantially 
realized, that those results will have the forecasted 
or expected consequences and effects. The forward-
looking statements in this report are made as of the 
date of this report, unless otherwise indicated, and 
we undertake no obligation to update these forward-
looking statements to reflect subsequent events  
or circumstances.
