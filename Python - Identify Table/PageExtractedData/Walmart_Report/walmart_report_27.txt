Sustainable supply chain
The Sustainability Index
Our aspirations for sustainable product supply 
chains go beyond managing risk in our own 
sourcing; we aim to bring about significant and 
lasting improvement across product supply chains 
through collaborative efforts with suppliers, NGOs 
and others. 
Walmart encourages suppliers to report through 
the Sustainability Index, a science-based, third-
party tool developed by The Sustainability 
Consortium in collaboration with universities, 
NGOs and suppliers. The Index includes data from 
suppliers on key environmental, social and other 
performance indicators at the category level.  
The Index reflects responses from more than 
1,500 unique suppliers covering 115 categories and 
departments across Walmart U.S. and Sam’s  
Club U.S. 
We set a goal in 2012 to buy 70% of our U.S.  
goods from suppliers that participate in the Index  
(in categories covered by the Index). We met that 
goal in 2017, and in 2018, more than 80% of such 
goods came from participating suppliers. Walmart 
and Sam’s Club U.S. suppliers have improved  
their Sustainability Index scores by 28% compared 
with 2016.20
