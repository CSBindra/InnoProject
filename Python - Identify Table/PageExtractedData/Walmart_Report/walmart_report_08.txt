Walmart has been reporting on a wide range of 
ESG topics since 2005. We did not seek, nor was 
there, external assurance from third parties with 
respect to most of the information in this report; 
exceptions are noted. 
Frameworks such as the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) Standards, the United Nations 
(U.N.) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) inspire our reporting. 
We also disclose to external reporting programs 
such as CDP. In 2018, we received an A- on our 
climate change disclosure. 
This report covers the activities of Walmart for 
the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 (FY2019) 
unless otherwise noted. This ESG Report responds 
to stakeholder requests for a more concise 
and focused view of our priority topics — how 
we define them and the long-term strategy to 
manage them; our aspirational goals and targets; 
and progress to date. “Walmart” means Walmart 
Inc., a Delaware corporation and its consolidated 
subsidiaries, excluding eCommerce subsidiaries, 
businesses, platforms and/or marketplaces, unless 
otherwise noted.
