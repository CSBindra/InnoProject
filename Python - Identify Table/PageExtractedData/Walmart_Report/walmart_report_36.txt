study on food waste. The study reviewed American 
supermarkets’ food waste reduction commitments, 
policies and actions. 
Food waste in our value chain
We undertake efforts to help eliminate food waste 
in our value chains beyond our own operations. As 
noted above in the discussion of fresh supply chain 
improvements, our efforts include reducing days in 
the supply chain from point of origin to store. 
As well, through Project Gigaton, Walmart is 
encouraging our suppliers to measure and report 
food waste; introduce reprocessing, donation and 
recycling practices; and standardize date labeling 
(when the date is required for quality reasons only) to 
eliminate customer confusion. In FY2018, 92% of our 
private-brand products in the U.S. used “Best If Used 
By” date labels unless a food safety or regulatory 
reason prevented us from doing so. Beyond our 
private-brand suppliers, we also advocate for other 
suppliers to standardize date labels across their 
brands in line with the Consumer Goods Forum’s 
Date Labeling Call to Action. 
Philanthropy
The Walmart Foundation’s philanthropic 
investments help drive system-wide 
change by investing in prevention efforts 
to stop food waste and loss from occurring, 
and the recovery and redistribution of 
edible food that would otherwise go to 
waste, specifically from farms and retail 
settings. The Walmart Foundation made 
a commitment to award $15 million to 
organizations that help reduce food waste 
and strengthen food banks in Canada 
from FY2017 through FY2020; more than 
$11 million has been allocated so far. The 
Walmart Foundation has also supported 
organizations such as the World Wildlife 
Fund in conducting research and analyzing 
policies that advance solutions for 
preventing food waste and loss.
