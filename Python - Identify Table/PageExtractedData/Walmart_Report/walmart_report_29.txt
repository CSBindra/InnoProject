We also pursue strategic initiatives for system-
wide improvements in product value chains. For 
example, because our customers told us they want 
more innovative product formulations, we launched 
a Sustainable Chemistry initiative with suppliers, 
retailers and NGOs. The chart provides additional 
examples of special initiatives. 
Philanthropy
We look to philanthropy as a means of catalyzing change in areas not reached through business 
initiatives. For example, we have made targeted grants supporting innovative approaches to 
regenerative agriculture, sustainable fisheries, forest preservation and waste reduction.
