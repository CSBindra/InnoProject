of commerce. Walmart offers resources to store 
leaders to help them listen to and effectively engage 
with local stakeholders; for example, stores are 
encouraged to use social media (e.g., Facebook  
and Instagram).
Philanthropy 
In the U.S., we empower each Walmart 
store, Sam’s Club and distribution center to 
strengthen and support its local community 
through local donations, fundraising and 
cause-marketing campaigns. In FY2019, 
our stores and clubs provided more than 
$42 million in local grants, which are 
designed to address the unique needs of the 
communities where we operate.  
 
Our associates around the world contribute 
their time, expertise and money to a range of 
causes they are passionate about, including 
Walmart-supported initiatives such as hunger 
relief and disaster relief. In the U.S. alone, 
more than 47,000 associates volunteered 
over 776,500 hours, generating more than 
$7.6 million in Walmart donations through 
our Volunteerism Always Pays program.
