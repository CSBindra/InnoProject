Walmart’s associates and customers live and work 
in many communities around the world. We aim to 
strengthen these communities through our stores, 
which provide access to affordable food and other 
products for daily needs; our jobs and advancement 
opportunities; and by supporting local causes.
Community engagement 
With more than 11,300 stores around the world, 
Walmart associates and customers belong to many 
communities. Walmart associates engage with 
customers and local organizations in several ways 
to understand and support local needs.
In the U.S., for example, before we open a new 
store, club or distribution center, Walmart meets 
with stakeholders such as community groups, 
chambers of commerce, elected officials and local 
chapters of national organizations to understand 
the needs of the neighborhood. In some 
instances, we convene community discussions on 
opportunities and challenges. 
We encourage our store leaders to engage in 
community life. In addition to charitable giving, 
our store leaders may host events for community 
leaders’ networks, serve on the boards of local 
nonprofits, speak at local events, and belong 
to community organizations such as chambers
