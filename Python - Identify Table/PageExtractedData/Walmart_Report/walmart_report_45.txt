One of society’s greatest challenges is helping 
workers gain the skills and knowledge they need 
to succeed in the jobs of today and prepare for 
the jobs of tomorrow. 
Today, millions of jobs are left unfilled as 
employers struggle to find workers with the 
skills needed to fill open positions. In the 
coming decades, growth in automation will likely 
exacerbate the skill development challenge as 
technology drives rapid change in the types of 
jobs available for workers and the capabilities 
they need to fulfill those roles.
The retail sector — as a foundational entry 
point to work, a place to gain valuable skills 
and a significant portion of the overall job 
market — provides a gateway to upward mobility 
for millions of people and can help address 
the global need for workforce development. 
Recognizing this, Walmart is committed to 
helping make retail a place of opportunity:  
a launching pad for people to acquire the  
skills and experience needed to advance in  
the workforce.
