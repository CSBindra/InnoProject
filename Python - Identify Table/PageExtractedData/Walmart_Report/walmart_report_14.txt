The aspirational goals, commitments and targets we 
set under priority topics are designed to help Walmart 
aim high, hold ourselves accountable and move at 
an aggressive pace. Our public ESG commitments 
galvanize action across our business through senior-
level oversight, policies and programs. We hold 
ourselves accountable through metrics, measurement 
and annual reporting, including the annual publication 
of our ESG Report. In 2016, our CEO Doug McMillon 
announced our 2025 commitments and targets. 
These are laid out in greater detail at the beginning of 
the Environmental and Social sections of this report. 
ESG issues are complex.  We believe that setting goals 
and driving action toward meeting them is necessary 
to advance progress on many environmental and 
social issues facing society.  Because success depends 
on the collective efforts of many, as well as factors 
such as technical advances, policy changes, economic 
and price volatility, and supplier engagement, there 
may be times where we fall short.  While we strive in 
each case to meet our goals and targets, sometimes 
challenges may delay or block progress.
