Digital skills
In a world being transformed by technology, all youth should have access to digital 
skills. From basic digital literacy to advanced computer science, learning digital skills 
provides young people an opportunity to develop creativity, critical thinking, and 
problem-solving skills. We partner with nonprofits, governments, educators, and 
businesses to reach young people who are least likely to have access to computer 
science education. Our approach includes:
• Strengthening the ability of nonprofit organizations and schools to offer computer science 
education
• Bringing CS to every young person
Through cash grants, technology, and resources, we support in-school programs like Technology 
Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS) and nonprofits like Code.org, to help increase the 
number of young people who have access to computer science education.
In partnership with Code.org and others, we encourage US states to provide access to computer 
science (CS) education and count CS courses toward math and science credits required for 
graduation.
