Global Reporting Initiative 
Index 
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provides corporations with a framework to 
guide their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting. The GRI Index is based 
on input from a wide range of civil society organizations, labor groups, businesses, 
academic institutions, and other experts. The 2018 Microsoft CSR report contains 
disclosures from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting 
Standards. We provide the GRI Content Index below to help our readers more easily 
locate the disclosures throughout the report.
