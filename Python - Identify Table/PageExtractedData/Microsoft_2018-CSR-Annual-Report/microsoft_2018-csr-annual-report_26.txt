Our approach Strengthening communities Protecting our planet ResourcesEmpowering people
FY18 highlights Microsoft continues to focus on business and human rights, and acts as a cata-
lyst for others who are participating in these efforts, in the technology sector and 
beyond.
Responsible sourcing
We’ve built an Audit Management System (AMS) to continue to transform how 
we embed compliance and sustainability into our business. Using Microsoft Power 
BI, we can track performance and enable continuous supply chain improvements 
throughout the SEA stages.

SEA Academy  
Our Social and Environmental Accountability (SEA) Academy online and mobile 
platform will enable us to scale learning more efficiently both internally and across 
our suppliers.
Worker hotline
Our Worker Hotline program continues to provide a voice for workers to privately 
and safely express issues and concerns and achieve issue resolution in all our Tier 1 
and select Tier 2 suppliers.
Children out of mining
We continue to grow our partnership with Pact to address child labor in the Dem-
ocratic Republic of the Congo. The program has received international recognition 
and has reduced child labor by 97 percent over the course of the project to date.

Raw materials to their origins  
To identify and prioritize risk, we completed our mapping of the origination of key 
raw materials that are used in our complex and global upstream supply chain.
Supplier diversity
We expanded our supplier diversity program to include a focus on LGBTQ-owned 
businesses. In FY18, Microsoft spent more than $3 billion with minority-, disabled-, 
veteran-, LGBTQ-, and woman-owned businesses, ranking among the top 20 com-
panies for spending with diverse-owned suppliers globally.
