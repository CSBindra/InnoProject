Training and development
To support our growth mindset culture and meet the learning needs of our em-
ployees around the world, we offer a diverse range of learning and development 
opportunities. We believe training can be more than formal instruction, and our 
training philosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in the 
right way. Opportunities include:
• Personalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on Microsoft Learning 
and LinkedIn Learning.
• In-the-classroom learning and sharing with learner boards. 
• On-the-job “stretch” opportunities for advancement.
• Frequent promotion opportunities.
• Coaching on career development through ongoing manager connections.
• Customized manager training to enhance coaching and mentoring skills.
• New employee orientation covering a range of topics including company values, culture, and 
Standards of Business Conduct.
Wellness and safety
Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well-being with comprehen-
sive benefits to help employees maximize their physical, financial, and social well-
ness. In addition, our Occupational Health and Safety program integrates appropri-
ate practices into our operations and works for continual improvement in employee 
health and safety. As part of this commitment:
• Professionals assess the safety risks of work activities and engage with workers and management 
to implement safe work practices, hazard controls, and training to minimize safety risks.
• New and existing workspaces are periodically assessed to ensure they are constructed with sound 
design-for-safety principles and that controls are implemented effectively.
• Microsoft involves employees and managers in Health and Safety Committees specific to our 
datacenters, retail operations, and office locations where required.
