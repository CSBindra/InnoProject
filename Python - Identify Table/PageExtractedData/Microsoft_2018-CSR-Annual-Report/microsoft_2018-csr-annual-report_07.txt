Microsoft works to align our CSR commitments and CSR reporting to global stan-
dards. We base our CSR reporting on the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability 
Reporting Guidelines. In 2006, we began endorsing the United Nations Global Com-
pact and we file an annual Communication on Progress implementing the 10 UNGC 
principles. In addition, we were among the first companies to align our human 
rights work with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to 
adopt the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. We’re actively engaged in 
supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals and publicly report how Micro-
soft contributes to the global effort to achieve the SDGs. 
We apply the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards to 
our CSR materiality assessment to define our most significant CSR issues. Using this 
approach, we’ve identified the top issues. Our CSR materiality assessment reflects 
input gathered from our stakeholder engagement processes, consultation with 
Business for Social Responsibility, other external experts, and consideration of the 
impact of our core businesses.
Based on this analysis, the top issues include:
• Applying technology for environmental and social good
• Accessibility  
• Climate change and energy 
• Data privacy and security 
• Empowering communities
• Ethical business practices
• Human capital
• Human rights
• Responsible sourcing and device lifecycle impacts
