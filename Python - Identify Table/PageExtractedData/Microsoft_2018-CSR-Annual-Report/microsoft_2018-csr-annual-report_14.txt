Microsoft 2018 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 14
Empowering people Strengthening communities Protecting our planet ResourcesOur approach
Last spring, I visited our AI School in Paris, France, which we started earlier this year 
to provide immersive training to help close the skills gap. Students from different 
backgrounds and walks of life, with no prior technical experience, are learning new 
data science skills. They take an intense seven month class, followed by an appren-
ticeship at one of our local partners — and are ready for new careers in AI and 
data science. While there, I met Cassandra Delage, a young entrepreneur with an 
ambitious dream of reimagining recycling. Her company, Plast’if, has created what 
might be best described as a “recycling vending machine.” You take plastic, put it in 
the machine, and it’s converted into a useful object you can take with you. She built 
it with students at the AI School, creating an ML model that recognizes the plastic, 
deploying it on an inexpensive computer and then integrating it with a 3-D printer 
— turning her novel idea into reality.
It’s just one example of how technology can help create new opportunity and build 
a better future for everyone.
And it’s just the start — I could not be more optimistic about what’s yet to come.
