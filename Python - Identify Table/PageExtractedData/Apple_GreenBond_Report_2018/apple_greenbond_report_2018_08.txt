8Annual Green Bond Impact Report  |  2018 Update
Daisy, Apple’s Materials Recovery Robot
We are also creating innovative ways to recover the materials used in 
our products, as part of our work to conserve resources. We created 
our newest disassembly robot, Daisy, to reclaim more of the valuable 
materials stored in iPhone. Existing techniques, such as shredding, 
recover only a few kinds of materials and often diminish their quality. 
Daisy can take apart up to 200 iPhone devices per hour, removing 
and sorting components, so we can recover materials that traditional 
recyclers can’t—and at a higher quality. By disassembling our products, 
we can direct components and materials to those recyclers who can 
recover more of the materials. These materials will then be sent back 
into secondary materials markets or directly back into our supply  
chain—reducing the need to mine more resources from the earth. 
Daisy builds on the learnings from Liam, our R&D experiment in 
automated disassembly that we announced in 2016. We created  
Daisy to have a smaller footprint and the capability to disassemble 
multiple models of iPhone with higher variation compared with Liam. 
Daisy is now up and running in both the U.S. and the Netherlands.  
Daisy processes end-of-life iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone SE,  
iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7,  
and iPhone 7 Plus devices.
