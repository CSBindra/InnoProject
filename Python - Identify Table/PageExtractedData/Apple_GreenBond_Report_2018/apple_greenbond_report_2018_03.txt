3Annual Green Bond Impact Report  |  2018 Update
Project Selection and Evaluation
A broad range of teams within Apple submitted projects for the  
allocation of green bond proceeds. Projects were selected based  
on the following factors:
• Alignment with eligibility criteria
• Reflection of our three environmental priorities
• Magnitude of environmental impact
• Measurability of environmental benefits
• Feasibility to track and audit project expenditures
• Allocation of funds within the eligible period (since the date of the 
applicable green bond issuance) 
Apple systematically calculates the environmental benefits of projects 
we implement, using this information to inform decision-making within 
the company. For the projects selected for the allocation of green bond 
proceeds, we measured the following performance indicators:
• Green buildings—Constructed square footage
• Renewable energy—Installed capacity and estimated energy generation 
• Energy efficiency—Electricity and natural gas savings
• Water conservation—Water savings
• Waste diversion—Waste diverted from landfills 
We believe these indicators help reflect the scale of impact that we 
expect our projects to have.
