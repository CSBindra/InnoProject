2Annual Green Bond Impact Report  |  2018 Update
Apple’s Green Bonds
Apple is committed to leaving the world better than we found it, and that 
commitment is considered in everything we do—from how we design  
our products to the processes we use to produce and recycle them. We 
believe it’s more important than ever that companies like Apple continue 
to demonstrate leadership in protecting our planet. In February 2016, we 
issued our first green bond (the 2016 Green Bond). It was also the first 
green bond issued by any U.S. tech company and, at $1.5 billion, the 
largest green bond issued by any U.S. corporation.
Following the historic climate change agreement at the 2015 United 
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, we wanted 
to demonstrate how businesses can lead in driving the reduction of 
global emissions. In June 2017, following the U.S. Administration’s 
announcement of its intention to withdraw from the agreement reached 
at COP21, we issued our second green bond (the 2017 Green Bond),  
this time for $1 billion. 
We hope to inspire other companies to follow. 
Our prior-year annual impact update report covered the full allocation  
of Apple’s 2016 Green Bond ($1,494.5 million1), and $162.8 million of 
Apple’s 2017 Green Bond. This year’s annual impact report covers the full 
allocation of Apple’s 2017 Green Bond ($995.2 million1) on environmental 
projects that incurred spend between June 20, 2017, and September 29, 
2018—the end of Apple’s 2018 fiscal year.
We’ve allocated 2017 Green Bond funds to a total of 28 eligible projects, 
including eight new projects in fiscal year 2018. These projects contribute 
to our three environmental priorities where we believe we can make the 
greatest impact:
• Reducing our impact on climate change by using renewable energy 
sources and driving energy efficiency in our facilities, products, and 
supply chain.
• Pioneering the use of safer materials in our products and processes.
• Conserving precious resources.
$2.5 billion
Apple has allocated $2.5 billion  
of green bond proceeds—in less  
than three years. These allocations  
reflect Apple’s commitment to  
projects that benefit our planet.
