Annual Green Bond Impact Report  |  2018 Update
Report notes:
•  In 2017, select projects received funding from both the 2016 and 2017 Green Bonds. In these 
instances, the environmental benefits of those projects were allocated to each green bond based 
on their respective funding ratios. Some of these projects were also allocated green bond funds 
in 2018; however, previously allocated environmental benefits were not reallocated between the 
two bonds. Only incremental environmental benefits generated in 2018 were attributed to the 
2017 Green Bond. 
•  Regarding environmental benefits, we estimated the future environmental benefits of projects 
that are not yet fully operational, including annual renewable energy generation, emissions 
avoided, and water savings. We estimated emissions avoided using regional emissions factors.
 1Represents net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses.
 2Estimated based on renewable energy generation once projects are fully operational.
 3 Estimated greenhouse gas emissions avoided are as a result of both renewable energy 
generation and energy efficiency. 
 4 Estimate is based on World Energy Council data on average electricity consumption of electrified 
households in Japan for 2014 (latest available year). https://wec-indicators.enerdata.net/world.php.
