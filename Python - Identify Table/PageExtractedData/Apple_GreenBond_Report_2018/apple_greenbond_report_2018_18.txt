18Annual Green Bond Impact Report  |  2018 Update
Report of Independent Accountants
To the Management of Apple Inc.:
We have examined management’s assertion, included in Exhibit A, that proceeds raised from the
June 2017 Green Bond offering were fully allocated to qualifying Eligible Projects that met the
Eligibility Criteria set forth in Table 1 of Exhibit A for the period between June 20, 2017 and
September 29, 2018 (the “Criteria”). Apple Inc.’s (“Apple”) management is responsible for the
assertion and having a reasonable basis for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the assertion based on our examination.
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management’s assertion is
fairly stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain
evidence about management’s assertion. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected
depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
management’s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our examination was not conducted for the purpose of evaluating the completeness of the Eligible
Project disbursements, the amount of Eligible Project disbursements by Eligibility Criteria, the
environmental benefits of the Eligible Projects, or any other information included in Apple’s Annual
Green Bond Impact Report, 2018 Update.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance other than on the amount of Eligible Project disbursements.
In our opinion, management’s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
Criteria.
