100% Recycled Aluminum
Our goal to conserve precious resources inspires us to use better 
materials in our products, even if alternatives are not readily available. 
We supported the trials needed to validate a new aluminum alloy made 
of 100 percent recycled materials. Previously, there wasn’t an aluminum 
alloy available that met both our strict performance and cosmetic 
specifications and our desire for higher recycled content. Our trials 
resulted in a new alloy that delivers the same strength, durability, and 
flawless finish our customers have come to expect of Apple products—
without mining aluminum from the earth. It’s reengineered down to the 
atomic level to accommodate various scrap sources of aluminum—often 
contaminated—while keeping its strength and beautiful cosmetics even 
after multiple rounds of recycling. And this alloy not only reduces the 
need for mined materials, it also reduces Apple’s carbon footprint. In 
2015, aluminum smelting was the single largest contributor to Apple’s 
carbon footprint, and in particular, smelting of aluminum used for 
MacBook notebook computers. Using this new alloy, we made the 
enclosures of the MacBook Air and Mac mini with 100 percent recycled 
aluminum, eliminating the need for aluminum smelting and thus cutting 
the carbon footprint of each product nearly in half. This represents a 
significant step that supports our work for both materials and climate.
