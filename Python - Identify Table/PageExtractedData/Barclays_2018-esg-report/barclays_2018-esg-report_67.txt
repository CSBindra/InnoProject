Tax contribution and approach to tax
We continue to make substantial tax 
payments across the jurisdictions in which we 
operate, both in terms of taxes paid and taxes 
collected. In the UK, we were the third largest 
taxpayer by reference to taxes paida  in 2018 
and we have consistently been one of the top 
three largest UK taxpayers in the last five 
years.
Our approach to tax is rooted in our overall 
purpose and values and has three core objectives:
1) Responsible approach to tax
We manage our tax affairs in accordance with 
our tax principles and tax code of conduct. We 
aim to ensure that our tax returns are filed on 
time and the correct amount of tax is paid.
2) Effective interaction with tax authorities 
We have a constructive and professional 
relationship with tax authorities and work 
with them to combat tax evasion. 
3) Transparency in relation to our tax affairs
We strive to be a leader in tax transparency by 
choosing to expand external publications such 
as the Country Snapshot and making clear 
disclosures to tax authorities.
We believe that it is important for our 
shareholders, customers, regulators, tax 
authorities and other stakeholders to 
understand our tax contribution in the countries 
in which we operate and our approach to tax.

Country Snapshot which is available online at:
