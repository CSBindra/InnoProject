10 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2018 home.barclays/annualreport
Banks play a key role in connecting the providers 
and users of capital and delivering wider financial 
services that enable individuals, business and 
economies to grow. 
Barclays is a key contributor to society and our 
success as a business has always been 
inextricably linked to the progress of the people 
and businesses that we serve. We will continue to 
identify new opportunities and strive to integrate 
our broader social and environmental impact into 
the way we run and govern our business and the 
work we do every day to help customers and 
clients, colleagues and society to rise.
We have managed ESG issues for several years 
and this is not a new consideration for our 
business. However, our approach continues 
to evolve in response to a dynamic external 
environment, increasing investor and other 
stakeholder attention and continued innovation 
in our business and product offerings. 
We recognise that the focus on the societal 
impact of businesses and performance on wider 
ESG factors has increased in recent years, with 
growing interest from a wider range of 
stakeholders including investors, clients, policy 
makers and regulators.
There is increasing evidence that effective 
management of ESG issues is an integral part of 
robust governance and business strategy with a 
potential link to financial performance and 
long-term business model resiliency. 
The ESG space is necessarily broad based and 
covers a wide range of factors from governance 
and conduct to human capital management 
and climate change. Recent academic research 
on the link between ESG and financial 
performance is starting to demonstrate that it is 
important for businesses to focus on industry 
and company-specific factors. 
Barclays conducts an annual internal process to 
identify issues that are material to our 
stakeholders and our business as defined by the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. 
See the box for an overview of the review 
process and high-level results.  
Our approach to managing Environmental,  
Social and Governance matters 
Approach
The 2018 ESG report has been developed 
in line with the principle of materiality as 
described in the GRI Standards. Every year, 
we review our materiality matrix in order to 
align it with current trends and the changing 
context of the business, and to ensure that it 
reflects feedback from ongoing stakeholder 
engagement. 
The process based on a review of what is 
relevant for our sector, the results of direct 
stakeholder engagement, including surveys 
and information requests from ESG rating 
agencies, and an analysis of relevant banking 
industry frameworks and reporting guidelines. 
This subjective assessment is based on a 
qualitative assessment of multiple sources 
and is not based on any formal financial or 
legal definitions of materiality. See below for 
an overview of key themes with further detail 
available in our GRI Index online at home.

We believe that the foundation for effective 
ESG management is robust and transparent 
governance and integration of these 
considerations into the way that we do 
business. This includes alignment with our 
overall strategy and embedding relevant 
matters into our risk management framework 
and our product and service offering. 
We do not adopt a one size fits all approach 
and recognise that the relevance, importance 
and response to issues will vary across the 
diversity of our business by product area, 
customer and client base and geography.
