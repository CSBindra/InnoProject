Context and approach
Our Values
Our five Values (as shown in the chart on the 
right), hold us to account and guide us to 
behave in the right way. They have always 
underpinned our Purpose and will continue to 
do so. Because ‘Creating opportunities to rise’ 
must never come at the cost of what is right. 
It will always be grounded in the deep-rooted 
Values of our organisation – Respect, Integrity, 
Service, Excellence and Stewardship.
The Barclays Code of Conduct – ‘The Barclays 
Way’ – outlines the Values and Behaviours 
which govern our way of working across our 
business globally. It constitutes a reference 
point covering all aspects of our working 
relationships, specifically with other Barclays 
employees, customers and clients, 
governments and regulators, business 
partners, suppliers, competitors and the 
broader community. The objective is to define 
the way we think, work and act at Barclays to 
ensure we deliver against our Purpose of 
‘Creating opportunities to rise’.
We want to see Barclays playing 
a key role in restoring the 
professionalism of banking and 
want this bank to be respected 
and admired for the strength of 
its character; for our ability to 
foster trust between Barclays 
and its customers, clients and 
society. 
The Barclays Way is aligned to the Code of 
Professional Conduct, published by the 
Chartered Banker Professional Standards 
Board, which sets out the ethical and 
professional attitudes and behaviours 
expected of bankers. Barclays subscribes to 
this code and is committed to ensuring the 
broad principles into our business continue 
to apply.
