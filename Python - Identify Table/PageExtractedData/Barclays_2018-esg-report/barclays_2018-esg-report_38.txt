Managing our environmental footprint
Company
Barclays is committed to managing our own operational 
footprint and reducing our absolute carbon emissions. 
Having achieved our existing goals, we have set 
ambitous new targets to reduce our emissions through 
the procurement of renewable energy and improve our 
waste recyling.

* We continuously review and update our performance 
data based on updated carbon emission factors, 
improvements in data quality and updates to estimates 
previously applied. For 2019 we have applied the 
latest DEFRA and IEA emission factors. Where our 
performance has changed we have restated the 
balances and baseline. Emissions (tonnes CO2e) 
previously reported for 2015, 2016, 2017 are 479,535, 
406,242 and 351,655 respectively.
Performance
In 2018, we reduced our emissions by 38%r
exceeding our 30% carbon reduction 
commitment from a 2015 baseline. This was 
achieved through the implementation of our 
managed energy efficiency programme which 
was aimed at improving the operational 
efficiency of our property portfolio and data 
centre estate. We also acknowlege that the 
reduction of greenhouse gas grid emission 
factors has contributed significantly towards 
our overall Group carbon reduction. We have 
seen a reduction in our business travel 
emissions through the implementation of 
stricter controls on travel and approval 
processes. 
Environment Policy
Barclays has a Group Property Policy which 
sets out criteria for environmental 
management, risk, opportunity and control for 
our buildings as we operate our business. 
Within the Property Policy we have 
environmental controls which range from 
aspects and impacts, pollution control 
through to environmental data reporting. 
These controls are audited internally by 
Barclays Internal Audit on an annual basis and 
control effectiveness is reported up to senior 
management as part of our Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework.
Within our Property Policy we include a 
commitment that any building investment 
over £5m will achieve an independent best 
practice standard for environmental 
performance. 
Environmental Management Systems
Barclays has ISO 14001 certificates across the 
top 100 energy consuming buildings in our 
portfolio which represent 33% of our total 
energy consumption. All our buildings are 
covered by Environmental Operating 
Procedures which are aligned to ISO 14001 
standards ensuring environmental best 
practice is delivered across all our portfolio. 
We have focused certification on our 
significant buildings globally based on 
employee number, profile in region (flagship 
sites, campus sites and or head quarter sites).

Objectives
As we draw our 2018 target to a close we 
have set ambitious goals to both 2025 
and 2030:
Green buildings
Managing our environmental impact is at the 
centre of our strategy – in fact, we have 21 
construction projects recognised with LEED 
(Leadership in Energy Efficiency and Design) 
accreditation across our portfolio. Our 
Piscataway Data Centre has achieved Energy 
Star rating for the fifth year in a row 
demonstrating best practice in energy 
efficiency within our Piscataway Data Centre.
