Access to financing
£27.3bnr  financing facilitated 
We have continued to build our capability to deliver financing 
solutions across a range of social and environmental segments 
including renewable energy, education, healthcare and 
development finance institutions. Our financing volume is tracked 
and screened using Barclays Impact Eligibility Framework, 
developed in collaboration with Sustainalytics a global provider of 
ESG and corporate governance, research, ratings and analytics. 
In 2018 Barclays facilitated £27.3bn in financing for specific social 
and environmental segments across our business (2017: £31.7bn). 
The reduction from prior year reflects market conditions, including 
the impact of changes in U.S. tax law which caused certain qualifying 
clients to accelerate new debt issuance from 2018 into 2017.
We expanded our green product portfolio, including the launch of 
the Barclays Green Home Mortgage, first green mortgage for retail 
customers by a mainstream UK bank, added Green Trade Finance 
to our Corporate Banking green product set and structured several 
innovative transactions such as the first Sustainability-linked 
Revolving Credit Facility for a US borrower.
2018 £27.3bn

The way we do business
–38%r  reduction in carbon emissions
We track a range of metrics focused on training our colleagues on 
our Code of Conduct, paying our suppliers on time and reducing 
carbon emissions. 99.9% of our colleagues completed training on 
the Barclays Way Code of Conduct. 
We continued to manage our operational environmental impacts, 
reducing global carbon emissions by 38% (2017: 26.1%) and 
exceeding our target of 30% reduction by 2018 against the 2015 
baseline. We also achieved 82% (2017: 89%) on-time payment by 
value to our suppliers (target: 85%). Supplier payment on time 
was below target due to a change in systems, which impacted 
performance during the year.
