dditional inform
ation
Barclays’ strategy and performance on ESG 
factors is evaluated by a range of external 
agencies. 
Although there is currently significant variance 
between methodologies, some of which may 
be relatively opaque, with limited consistency 
in the underlying data used at present, both 
within and across sectors, we believe it is 
important that these agencies, working with 
companies, investors and other market 
participants, continue to enhance consistency 
and transparency to support increasingly 
robust ESG data and ratings in the future. 
Clear and credible ESG information is critically 
important to enable effective investment 
decision-making, support company and 
investor engagement and underpin the 
growing range of products based on ESG 
factors.
Across a set of key ESG Ratings, our 
performance was broadly stable year-on-year 
with methodology changes the primary 
drivers of scoring instead of underlying 
changes in approach or performance. 
We continue to enhance disclosures on ESG 
factors and provide detailed information on 
our positions and policy statements. As a 
signficant driver of ESG ratings performance is 
underpinned by disclosure, we would expect 
this to support our scores over time. 
ESG Ratings  
The FTSE4Good ESG Rating  was flat at 4.3/5 
(2017: 4.3/5) with an 81st percentile ranking 
against the global banks sector. 
Barclays was rated BBB by MSCI ESG Ratings  
(2017:’BBB’). 
We scored 60 points in Sustainalytics ESG  
Ratings (2017: 61 points). 
We saw a decline in our RobecoSAM  scores 
due to changes in methodology, down by 4 
points to 75 points (2017:79 points), against a 
sector average of 54 points.  
Disclosure Ratings 
Institutional Shareholder Services  (ISS) 
released new environmental and social quality 
scores to assess corporate disclosures. On a 
1-10 scale where 1 is highest, Barclays was 
rated as ‘1’ for social reporting and ‘2’ for 
environmental reporting.  
Barclays was rated as A- in the 2018 Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) climate 
questionnaire, up from B in 2017.  The 2018 
survey included several new questions aligned 
with the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
recommendations. 
We recognise that markets and stakeholders 
need clear, relevant and consistent 
information and we will continue to focus on 
enhancing disclosures, particularly on climate 
change, and across wider ESG factors, 
including the TCFD recommendations.
