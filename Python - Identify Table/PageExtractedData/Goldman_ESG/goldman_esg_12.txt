ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
We approach the management of environmental and social risks with the same care and discipline as any  
other business risk. 
Our advisory, financing and investing teams integrate environmental and social factors as part of their normal-course due 
diligence. Our Environmental Markets Group (EMG) further assists transaction teams by providing guidance, conducting 
independent reviews and, where relevant, identifying positive engagement opportunities with the potential client to reduce 
material environmental and social risk. 
Learn more about our environmental and social risk management process and scope, as well as our due  
diligence guidelines.
