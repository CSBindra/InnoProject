We remain focused on and committed to upholding sound governance practices to protect  the long-term 
interests of our shareholders and create enduring value for our firm and for  all stakeholders. 
GOVERNANCE
ENSURING EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT THROUGH 
SOUND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
Our Board of Directors has 
implemented sound governance 
practices to fulfill its responsibility 
for oversight of the firm’s business 
and affairs. These include an 
independent lead director with 
expansive duties; regular executive 
sessions of independent and 
nonemployee directors; directors’ 
ability to contact any firm employee 
directly; and shareholders’ rights to 
call a special meeting and nominate 
directors via proxy access.
To ensure our Board is operating 
effectively, our independent lead 
director leads annual Board and 
Committee evaluations, which 
incorporate feedback on individual 
director performance. Further, the 
Board’s Governance Committee 
annually reviews the Board’s 
leadership structure to ensure it is 
the most efficient and appropriate 
structure for our firm’s needs.
