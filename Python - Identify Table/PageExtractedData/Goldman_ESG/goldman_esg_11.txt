SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR OPERATIONS: OUR PROGRESS TOWARD 2020 
We are focused on responsibly managing 
our operational impact, which is integral 
to a sound environmental policy and 
a necessary complement to our core 
business activities.   
We have made significant progress on  
the environmental commitments set out  
in our updated 2015 Environmental Policy 
Framework. We have achieved carbon 
neutrality for our global operations and 
business travel through a mix of certified 
renewable energy credits and carbon 
offsets. In 2016, we procured certified 
renewable energy credits equivalent  
to 90 percent of our global electricity 
consumption, and we aim to procure  
100 percent renewable power to meet our 
global electricity needs by 2020. We plan  
to achieve this goal by prioritizing the use 
of long-term power purchase agreements 
that facilitate the development of 
renewable energy resources, with the 
remainder through the procurement of 
certified renewable energy credits.
