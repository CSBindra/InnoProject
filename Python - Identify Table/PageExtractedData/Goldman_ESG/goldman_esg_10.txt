ENVIRONMENT
HARNESSING FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS  
TO DRIVE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES
HARNESSING NATURE 
THROUGH FIRST-OF-ITS-
KIND ENVIRONMENTAL 
IMPACT BOND
Our Urban Investment Group 
worked with the District of 
Columbia Water and Sewer 
Authority (“DC Water”) 
and Calvert Foundation in 
structuring and investing 
in the first-of-its-kind 
Environmental Impact Bond 
(EIB) issued by DC Water.
The EIB uses an innovative 
performance-linked structure 
to fund green infrastructure 
(e.g., permeable pavement, 
rain gardens) that harnesses 
nature in order to manage 
stormwater runoff, helping  
to reduce pollution in  
the District’s waterways  
while also stimulating local  
job creation.
INVESTING AND  
FINANCING RENEWABLES 
GROWTH IN INDIA
We have invested nearly  
$370 million in ReNew Power, 
helping establish the first 
dedicated renewable energy 
developer in India to surpass  
1 gigawatt in commissioned  
wind and solar projects.
In recent months, we signed a 
new long-term power purchase 
agreement, which enabled ReNew 
to build a 50-megawatt solar power 
plant. Together with existing  
wind capacity, this will meet up to  
70 percent of the energy needs  
of our Bengaluru campus.
We most recently served as  
joint global coordinator and book 
runner on ReNew’s $475 million 
green bond, leveraging an 
innovative structure to expand 
the company’s access to 
international investors. The bond 
provided ReNew with access to 
long-dated debt capital to 
refinance 500 megawatts of solar 
and wind projects across India.
EXPANDING  
THE MARKET FOR  
GREEN BONDS
We served as lead left  
book runner for Apple  
Inc.’s landmark $1.5 billion, 
seven-year green bond 
tranche, the first from a U.S. 
tech company and the largest 
by a U.S. corporate to date. 
Apple’s green bond helped 
demonstrate how businesses 
can help lead in driving 
environmental impact and 
won Environmental Finance’s 
corporate green bond of  
the year award for 2016. The 
proceeds from the offering  
are being used to fund 
renewable energy, energy 
efficiency and green  
materials projects.
TRANSFORMING A  
LEADING EUROPEAN  
UTILITY
We served as joint global 
coordinator and joint book 
runner on innogy SE’s  
$5.1 billion initial public 
offering, the largest IPO  
in Germany since 2000  
and Europe’s largest IPO  
since 2011.
German utility RWE carved 
out innogy as a newly formed 
entity that is focused on 
developing renewable energy, 
modernizing the power 
grid that transmits power 
to customers, and selling 
electricity to customers. 
innogy’s core business areas 
are focused on utility segments 
that benefit from the secular 
trends of decarbonization, 
decentralization and 
digitization of the energy 
system.
