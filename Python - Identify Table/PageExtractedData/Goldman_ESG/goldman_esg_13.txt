ATTRACTING A BROAD TALENT POOL
Developing top talent starts with recruiting the best, most diverse people into the 
firm. To reach and evaluate a broader and more diverse applicant pool, we are 
leveraging technology more than ever. In 2016, we conducted first-round interviews 
via video for the first time, enabling us to engage with candidates from more than 
900 schools for our 2017 intern class, reaching 100 more schools compared to 2016. 
On an absolute basis, we interviewed more women and more ethnically diverse 
candidates for the 2017 class than we ever had in the past.
Several enhancements to our campus recruiting efforts enabled  
us to target a wider array of schools and drive greater consistency  
throughout the recruiting process.

engaging and providing the right 
environment for our people to achieve
