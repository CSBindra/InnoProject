SEA Supplier Engagement ElementsSEA Supplier  
Engagement Approach
Microsoft’s Supplier Code of Conduct and SEA 
requirements are incorporated into our contracts 
with Tier 1 suppliers that manufacture our hardware 
components and products, and strategic Tier 2 
suppliers and other suppliers contracted by  
Microsoft to provide components and/or materials 
to our Tier 1 suppliers. We also require these suppli-
ers to address the SEA requirements with their own 
upstream and downstream suppliers with which 
Microsoft does not contract directly. Microsoft’s 
factory and sourcing managers partner with our 
SEA team of experts to ensure that Microsoft’s labor 
rights, ethics, environment, occupational health, 
and safety requirements are met.
We raise the performance bar with our existing 
suppliers while onboarding new suppliers. All new 
and directly contracted hardware and packaging 
suppliers undergo initial risk assessments and initial 
capability assessments and audits. A combination of 
third-party auditors and/or members of Microsoft’s 
SEA team conduct these audits and assessments 
using a checklist composed of the Electronics 
Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) requirements 
and additional Microsoft requirements on labor, 
environmental protection, ethics, worker health and 
safety, and management systems. During the review 
process, auditors examine documentation; visit 
production lines, dorms, canteens, and waste 
storage facilities; and conduct face-to-face  
interviews of workers and factory management.  
To ensure consistency and quality of third-party 
audits, Microsoft pre-qualifies third-party auditors 
through shadow audits and assessments of their 
onsite audit performance and reports.
