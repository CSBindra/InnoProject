51Microsoft 2015 Citizenship Report
9 Number of instances found of critical/serious non-conformances by third-party audits and Microsoft SEA 
assessments (which are both based on the EICC audit protocols with additional Microsoft requirements).
10 Percentage represents number of the suppliers with critical/serious findings on each issue out of the base 
of 138 suppliers audited.
11 The two cases are related to student workers, whose original ID cards were kept by their teacher.
12 Examples of these nine nonconformances include two child labor issues and seven issues of student 
workers working overtime. Neither child labor nonconformance found underage workers in the factory: 
one found evidence of past underage workers and one found insufficient documentation of legal proof of 
age. In both cases, the factories instituted new procedures for verifying and documenting proof of age to 
prevent hiring underage workers.
13 The case is related to incomplete and inaccurate attendance records of workers.
14 Examples of the cases involved factories not paying sufficient overtime compensation according to the 
local minimum wage.
15 This case is for requiring a pregnancy test for female workers during the onboarding health examination.
