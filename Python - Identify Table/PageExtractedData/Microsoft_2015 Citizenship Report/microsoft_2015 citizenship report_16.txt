Highlights of Corporate Governance Practices 1
Corporate governance at Microsoft is designed to promote the long-term interest 
of our shareholders, maintain internal checks and balances, strengthen management 
accountability, engender public trust, and foster responsible decision 
making and accountability.
Role and Structure of  
the Board of Directors 
Through oversight, review, and counsel, 
Microsoft’s Board of Directors establishes and 
promotes Microsoft’s business and organizational 
objectives. The board oversees the company’s 
business affairs and integrity, works with manage-
ment to determine the company’s mission and 
long-term strategy, performs the annual CEO 
evaluation, oversees CEO succession planning, 
establishes internal control over financial 
reporting, and assesses company risks and 
strategies for risk mitigation.
The board routinely reviews evolving practices to 
determine those that will best serve the interests 
of our shareholders. Microsoft is a leader in  
adopting standards to increase accountability 
to our shareholders, including early adoption of 
majority voting for board directors, Say on Pay 
advisory votes on executive compensation, and 
most recently, a proxy access bylaw. 
Microsoft’s Board of Directors maintains four 
standing committees to assist it in discharging its 
oversight responsibilities: an Audit Committee, 
a Compensation Committee, a Governance and 
Nominating Committee, and a Regulatory and 
Public Policy Committee. Only independent direc-
tors serve on these committees. Each committee 
has duties assigned by the board in compliance 
with Microsoft’s Bylaws and committee charters, 
which are available online. 
Among the responsibilities of the Regulatory  
and Public Policy Committee is reviewing and  
providing guidance to the Board and manage-
ment about the Company’s policies and programs 
that relate to corporate citizenship, including 
human rights, environmental sustainability, 
corporate social responsibility, supply chain 
management, charitable giving, and political 
activities and expenditures.
