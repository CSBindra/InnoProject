35Microsoft 2015 Citizenship Report
4.3 Technology for Good 
Microsoft helps build nonprofits’ capacity to use technology to be more efficient, 
effective, and innovative in doing their important work. In addition, in FY15 Microsoft 
donated software, services, and hardware—worth $922 million—to more than 
120,000 nonprofit organizations around the globe.
In FY15, we continued to expand our Office 365 
Nonprofit offer to reach a total of 110 countries. 
The program provides nonprofits with free access 
to the latest Microsoft Office cloud service, which 
includes anywhere access to Microsoft Office 
applications and professional email, calendar, 
instant messaging (IM), and web conferencing 
tools. The offering allows nonprofits’ employees 
and strategic volunteers to access Office applica-
tions and documents anywhere across multiple 
devices; enables easy collaboration through 
content sharing; and offers efficient administrative 
controls so organizations can spend less time and 
resources on IT maintenance. 
Through this program in FY15 we activated 1.09 
million new Office 365 seats among nonprofits.  
In its first two years, Office 365 Nonprofit offers 
have provided licenses for 2.7 million nonprofit 
employees and strategic volunteers. 
We also host NGO Connection Days around the 
globe for nonprofit organizations to learn how 
technology can help them become more efficient 
and effective in their work. In FY15, Microsoft 
collaborated with nonprofits by hosting 89 NGO 
Connection Days in 59 countries.
