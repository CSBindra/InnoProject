4.5 Employee Giving and Volunteerism 
The foundation of all of our efforts  
to serve communities is the passion  
of our employees. 
Outside the US, employees can take up to three paid 
days off to volunteer in their local communities. In the 
US, our Employee Giving Program matches employee 
gifts of money and time to nonprofits up to $15,000 
annually. In FY15, we increased our company volunteer 
match to $25 per hour so that, as an example, four 
hours of volunteer time results in a $100 donation 
from Microsoft to the nonprofit. In FY15, 67 percent 
of Microsoft’s US employees participated in the 
Employee Giving Program.
To encourage employees to volunteer, we maintain 
an extensive database of volunteer opportunities and 
host an organized Day of Caring for team-based group 
volunteer efforts for employees around the Seattle 
area and many of our other locations. We also actively 
recruit employees to participate as volunteer computer 
science educators through our TEALS Program. This 
year we took a new step to match our employees’ 
technical expertise with nonprofit needs for technology 
support. Tech Talent for Good launched with a varied 
portfolio of twenty nonprofits in Washington state, and 
we will expand the program in FY16.
