7Microsoft 2015 Citizenship Report
Microsoft’s citizenship mission is to serve globally the needs of communities and to 
fulfill our responsibilities to the public. In doing so, we seek to apply the power of 
our corporate policies and business practices, our products, and our investments in 
communities to advance our company mission to empower every person and every 
organization on the planet to achieve more.
The charter for the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee of our Board 
of Directors includes the responsibility to “review and provide guidance to the 
board and management about the company’s policies and programs that relate 
to corporate citizenship, including human rights, environmental sustainability, 
corporate social responsibility, supply chain management, charitable giving, and 
political activities and expenditures.” It does so on a semi-annual basis.
1.2 Citizenship Governance
Microsoft’s Citizenship and Public Affairs team  
sits within our Legal and Corporate Affairs Group 
and drives initiatives and engages with groups 
across Microsoft to help the company fulfill its 
responsibilities as a global corporate citizen 
and deliver added value to the company and 
its stakeholders. This team of 30+ professionals 
develops our global citizenship strategies and 
works in partnership with local Microsoft citizen-
ship and corporate affairs professionals around 
the world to advance our citizenship commitments 
wherever we do business. The General Manager 
of Citizenship and Public Affairs reports directly to 
Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and General 
Counsel, who sits on CEO Satya Nadella’s Senior 
Leadership Team. 
More broadly, citizenship at Microsoft relies 
on the combined efforts of all our employees, 
including colleagues in dozens of other leader-
ship roles, business and operational groups, and 
global subsidiaries. Together, they help identify 
emerging issues and societal challenges where 
Microsoft can add the greatest value, develop 
and implement new strategies and programs, 
and monitor our progress.
