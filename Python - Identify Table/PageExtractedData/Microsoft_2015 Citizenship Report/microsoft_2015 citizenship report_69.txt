Microsoft Research
Microsoft supports environmental research that 
isn’t tied to developing a specific product or 
service, but rather advances the field of comput-
ing and demonstrates how cloud services and 
mobile devices can combine to help solve some 
of society’s biggest environmental challenges. Our 
own Microsoft Research (MSR) team is working 
on identifying and creating the next generation of 
climate change models, tools, and technologies 
that will continue to drive our company and the 
world forward, including the following:
• Scientists at Microsoft Research Cambridge are 
working with the United Nations Environment 
Programme World Conservation Monitoring 
Centre to develop a model and tools that will 
help scientists and policy makers assess how—
in the face of an expanding population and 
expanding resource use per capita—to balance 
the need for increased food, timber, and textiles 
production, with industrial use of natural 
resources, with the healthy functioning of 
natural, semi-natural, and artificial ecosystems.
• Microsoft Research’s Earth, Energy, and 
Environment collaboration projects focus on the 
development and adoption of technologies for 
scientific visualization and data management—
especially technologies that accelerate insight 
into the environmental and earth sciences.
