16 Note that because the CDP reporting deadline closes in May before 
the end of our fiscal year, the most recent CDP carbon footprint  
data we have available and verified is for FY14, not FY15. We will  
disclose updated FY15 data before the end of the calendar year at 
www.microsoft.com/transparencyhub. Our greenhouse gas and 
energy data provided in our CDP filings and this report represent 100 
percent of Microsoft’s global operations and revenue.
17 The reported emissions for this category represent an estimate based 
on broad-based assumptions and have therefore been rounded. This 
category may be under- or over-reported by as much as 50 percent.
18 Energy (electricity) data includes on-site solar generation as well as all 
electricity purchased and consumed.
 mtCO2e = metric tons CO2 equivalent; MWh = megawatt hours.
The following graphs and charts detail the highlights of our most recent filing with CDP and trends in our 
greenhouse gas emissions and energy use.16
