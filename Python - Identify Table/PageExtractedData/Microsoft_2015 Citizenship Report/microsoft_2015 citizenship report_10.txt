10Microsoft 2015 Citizenship Report
Citizenship Materiality Assessment1.4
We recognize that our citizenship commitments 
have always played an important role in enabling 
Microsoft’s business success, but perhaps never 
more so than now. Microsoft is in the midst of a 
transformation into a productivity and platform 
company that will thrive in the mobile-first, cloud-
first world. As we explain in depth in our annual 
report, key elements of this vision include creating 
more personal computing, building the intelligent 
cloud, and reinventing productivity and business 
processes. Our citizenship commitments and the 
effective management of these top issues play an 
important part in earning and keeping the trust 
of our customers and other stakeholders and our 
ability to realize our long-term business strategy.
To apply the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to 
our citizenship materiality assessment, we follow the common practice of defining 
our most significant citizenship issues as those ranking highest both in business 
importance to Microsoft and in importance to our key stakeholders.
This aligns with how we set our citizenship  
strategies and commitments to drive both  
positive impacts to our business and to society. 
Following are the top citizenship issues we identi-
fied using this approach. It reflects input gathered 
from our stakeholder engagement processes 
described in the previous section, consultation 
with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and 
other external experts, and consideration of the 
impacts of Microsoft’s core business priorities.
