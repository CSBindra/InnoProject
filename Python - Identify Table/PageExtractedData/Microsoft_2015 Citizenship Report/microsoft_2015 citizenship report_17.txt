Spring
Our corporate gover-
nance cycle begins with 
reviewing governance 
best practices, regulatory 
developments, and our 
own policies and 
practices. This analysis 
informs the annual 
update of our gover-
nance framework and 
policies.
Summer
We communicate to our 
shareholders significant 
changes to our gover-
nance practices along 
with other developments 
at Microsoft. We speak 
with a cross-section of 
our investors holding 
a significant portion of 
our outstanding shares 
about this information 
and solicit input on 
topics that are important 
to them, which we 
communicate to the 
Board and incorporate as 
part of what we address 
in our proxy.
Fall
We publish our annual 
communications to 
shareholders and other 
stakeholders:
• our annual report
• proxy statement and
• citizenship report
We speak again with 
investors about 
important topics to be 
addressed at our annual 
shareholders meeting. 
We then hold our annual 
shareholders meeting.
Winter
The cycle concludes with 
the annual Board and 
committee evaluations, 
which include consider-
ing feedback received 
from shareholders during 
the preceding year.

Shareholder Engagement 
We seek to proactively provide investors with  
corporate governance information through 
diverse communications, including a director 
video interview series and direct communica-
tions from independent members of our board to 
shareholders. In 2009, we began posting video 
interviews with members of the board of directors 
to provide deeper insights into their backgrounds 
and perspectives on board service. In May, we 
posted our most recent interview with Mason 
Morfit, a Microsoft board member since 2014  
and president of ValueAct Capital. During the 
conversation, Mason speaks about his background 
at ValueAct Capital, his views on Microsoft’s 
leadership, and where he thinks the company is 
headed next. He also offers a behind-the-scenes 
view of how the board operates, and talks about 
the importance of shareholder engagement.
Our board video series, Microsoft on the Issues 
blogs, and annual letter from the Governance and 
Nominating Committee of the board are a few 
examples of our investor outreach efforts. With 
over 3.4 million shareholders, these are examples 
of one-to-many communications that provide the 
scale to reach all of our shareholders. Our Investor 
Relations website and its Governance & Citizen-
ship tab take the same approach.
We use a variety of other methods to engage  
with our shareholders. Over the past year,  
independent members of our board and members 
of senior management conducted outreach to a 
cross-section of shareholders owning approxi-
mately 40 percent of outstanding shares. Senior 
members of our management team also speak 
with our shareholders and provide the feedback 
received directly to our board. Our CEO, Satya 
Nadella, remains committed to investing time with 
our shareholders to increase transparency and 
better understand their perspectives, including by 
participating in our quarterly earnings calls.
The following diagram shows our annual outreach 
efforts and corporate governance cycle.
