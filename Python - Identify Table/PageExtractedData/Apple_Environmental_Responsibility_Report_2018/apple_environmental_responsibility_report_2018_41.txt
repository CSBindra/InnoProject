External Engagement 
We can do a lot. But we can’t do it alone. 
We want insights and ideas from those who share our commitment to 
removing toxins. So we formed our own Green Chemistry Advisory Board, 
made up of some of the world’s leading toxicologists, researchers, and 
academics. The board helps us identify innovative ways to minimize or 
eliminate toxins from our supply chain. We also invite experts from around 
the world to meet with leaders at Apple. Together, we focus on eliminating 
toxins at each stage of our process, while sharing our learnings through 
Green America’s Clean Electronics Production Network. And we seek out the 
best ideas and insights from key NGOs to help us make our products and 
processes even safer.
