57Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Denmark has a long tradition of biomass energy generation from agricultural 
waste products. Apple is partnering with Aarhus University (Viborg campus) 
to co-develop an agricultural waste biomass project. Methane from the 
biomass digester reaction will be used to create renewable electricity for 
our data center. Much of the agricultural waste going into the digester will 
come from local farms in a mutually beneficial relationship. They bring us 
their agriculture waste material to use as feedstock for the digester, and we 
give them the nutrient-rich by-product of the digestion process, which they 
can apply to their fields.

Our colocation facilities 
The majority of our online services are provided by our own data centers; 
however, we also use third-party colocation facilities for additional data 
center capacity. While we don’t own these shared facilities and use only a 
portion of their total capacity, we include our portion of their energy use in 
our renewable energy goals. Over 99 percent of our power for colocation 
facilities is matched with renewable energy generated within the same state 
or NERC region for facilities in the United States, or within the same country 
or regional grid for those around the world. And we will keep working with 
the colocation suppliers to get to 100 percent. 
Furthermore, we worked with one of our main suppliers of colocation 
services to help it develop the capability to provide renewable energy 
solutions to its customers. This partnership advances Apple’s renewable 
energy program and those of other companies that use this colocation 
provider. 
Beyond the use of our own data centers and colocation facilities, we also 
use third-party computing services to support some of our on-demand 
cloud storage–based services. We encourage these suppliers to adopt a 
100 percent renewable energy strategy for their energy use.
