¹  We calculate “default utility emissions” to provide baseline emissions of what our carbon footprint would have been without the use of 
renewable energy. This allows us to demonstrate the savings resulting from our renewable energy program. 
²  Apple’s greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating 
market-based emissions. 
³  We calculate our progress toward our 100 percent renewable energy goal on a calendar year basis. In calendar year 2017, 99% of the 
electricity used at our colocation facilities was powered by renewable energy. Beginning January 2018, it is at 100%. 
?  Over the past two years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in FY2016, we 
started reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based 
on maximum contract capacity quantities. We’ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple’s 
operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we‘ve removed from our electricity usage and Scope 2 calculations those 
emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations. This energy use, however, is still covered by renewable energy.
