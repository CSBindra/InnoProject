4Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
As we worked to reach 100 percent renewable energy for our own 
operations, we began to challenge our suppliers to make the same 
transition to clean energy through our supplier clean energy program. 
As of April 2018, 23 manufacturers have committed to power all of 
their Apple operations with 100 percent renewable energy. And we’re 
well on our way to meeting our goal of putting 4 gigawatts of new 
clean energy online in our supply chain by 2020.
We also made progress toward our goal to one day make new products 
without mining new materials from the earth. We hope to get there by 
using only recycled or renewable materials in our products, and returning 
an equivalent amount of material back to the market, to be used by us 
or others. 
Like everything at Apple, this effort is driven by innovation. We’ve 
developed a brand-new robot, Daisy, capable of disassembling nine 
versions of iPhone, and sorting their high-quality components for 
recycling. To help keep Daisy busy, we’re making it easier than ever 
for customers to recycle their old Apple devices through our new 
Apple GiveBack experience. 
There’s a lot more to our story over the past year. As you read through 
this Environmental Progress Report, we are busy working toward our  
next frontiers in clean energy, materials recovery, and green chemistry. 
We are proud of our work and look forward to continuing our journey.
