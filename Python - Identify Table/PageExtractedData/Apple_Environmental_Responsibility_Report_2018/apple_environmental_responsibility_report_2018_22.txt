Mining less from the earth. And more 
from old devices.
Our newest disassembly robot, Daisy, is the most innovative and efficient 
way to reclaim more of the valuable materials stored in iPhone. Existing 
techniques, such as shredding, recover only a few kinds of materials and 
often diminish their quality. Daisy can take apart up to 200 iPhone devices 
per hour, removing and sorting components, so we can recover materials 
that traditional recyclers can’t—and at a higher quality. By meticulously 
disassembling our products, we can direct components and materials to 
those recyclers who can recover what‘s important. These materials will then 
be sent back into secondary materials markets—closing the loop on these 
materials and reducing the need to mine more resources from the earth.
Daisy builds upon the learnings from Liam, our R&D experiment in 
automated disassembly that we announced in 2016. We created Daisy 
to have a smaller footprint and the capability to disassemble multiple 
models of iPhone with higher variation compared to Liam.
