Corporate Fiber Footprint Review 
Client: Apple Inc. 1
Review Statement 
Comprehensive Fiber Footprint 
Fraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple’s comprehensive fiber footprint data related to corporate 
fiber usage from products, corporate, and retail operations in fiscal year 2017.  
1 Summary 
This review checks transparency of data and calculations, appropriateness of supporting 
product and packaging related data and assumptions, and overall plausibility of the 
calculated annual fiber footprint of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2017 and of 
corporate and retail operations in the same period.  
As there is no standardised method available for calculating a product or company fiber 
footprint Apple defined a methodology for internal use. The scope of the comprehensive 
fiber footprint includes Apple’s fiber usage from products, corporate, and retail operations. 
The comprehensive fiber footprint tracks the total amount of wood, bamboo, and bagasse 
fiber, both virgin and recycled, that Apple uses in packaging (“Packaging Fiber”), and other 
paper products such as retail bags, photo books and non-product related corporate use 
(“Corporate Fiber”).  
Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and sums up these 
figures for the entire company using sell-in numbers. The output is a total fiber footprint.  
Data reported by Apple is as follows: 
  Total Fiber Virgin Fiber Recycled Fiber 
2017 Packaging Fiber 145,000 51,000 94,000 
Corporate Fiber 3,000 1,000 2,000 
Total 148,000 52,000 96,000
