26Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Packaging 
We’re using more recycled and  
responsibly sourced materials in  
our packaging.
Forests provide wood fiber for the paper in our product packaging. They 
also clean our air, purify our water, and provide wildlife habitat. We look 
for ways to use more recycled and responsibly sourced paper, to create 
technologies that use paper more efficiently, and to find alternatives to 
plastic. In fiscal year 2017, 100 percent of the paper in our packaging was 
from responsibly managed forests, controlled wood, or recycled sources. 
We’re replacing some plastic components with materials like bamboo fiber 
and bagasse, a by-product of sugarcane. And we’ve reached our goal to 
protect and create enough sustainably managed forests around the world 
to cover our current paper use and produce fiber for generations. The 
results are more beautiful than ever—for our packaging and for the planet.
Reducing our plastic use.
In fiscal year 2017, U.S. product packaging used on average 29 percent less 
plastic than in 2016, made possible by replacing plastic with responsibly 
sourced and recycled paper. For example, we‘ve replaced the plastic 
EarPods case with a paper alternative. Starting with iPhone 7, iPad Pro, 
and the new iPad launched in March 2018, we changed the plastic tray 
in the packaging to an all molded fiber alternative. And we replaced the 
expanded polystyrene that protects iMac Pro during shipping with paper 
padding made from 100 percent recycled fiber.

The U.S. retail packaging of the 
iMac Pro contains 78 percent less 
plastic than the similarly sized 27-inch 
iMac with Retina 5K display, and  
contains 85 percent recycled content.

In fiscal year 2017, our U.S. product packaging used on average 29 percent less 
plastic than in 2016. Recycled fiber now represents 64 percent of packaging fiber. 
And we are now sourcing 100 percent of the virgin fiber in our packaging from  
sustainably managed forests or controlled wood.
