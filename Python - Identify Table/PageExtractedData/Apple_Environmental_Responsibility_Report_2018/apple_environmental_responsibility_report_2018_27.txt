27Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Sourcing virgin paper responsibly.
Wherever possible, we use recycled paper. But when virgin paper is needed 
in our packaging, we require our suppliers to source it from sustainably 
managed forests or FSC controlled wood sources.17 In 2017, all of our 
packaging suppliers sourced their paper responsibly. And we conduct 
regular audits to ensure their claims.
Our corporate office paper use—which includes printing paper, paper 
towels, and toilet paper—represented less than 2 percent of our total fiber 
footprint. In fiscal year 2017, approximately 80 percent of our corporate 
paper use was from recycled sources or sustainably managed forests. 
And in some of our offices in China, we’re sourcing paper from one of  
the sustainably managed forests created in partnership with World Wildlife 
Fund (WWF).
Protecting sustainable forests.
In addition to specifying that all of our virgin fiber be sourced responsibly, 
we also wanted to make sure we weren’t diminishing the world’s supply of 
responsible paper. So we set a goal to protect or create enough sustainably 
managed forests to cover all of our product packaging needs.18 For 
the second consecutive year, production from our forest conservation 
projects exceeded the amount of virgin fiber we use in Apple’s product 
packaging. As our paper demands grow and change, we will continue 
protecting and creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all 
our packaging needs.
100% 
All the fiber in our product packaging  
is now 100% responsibly sourced.
