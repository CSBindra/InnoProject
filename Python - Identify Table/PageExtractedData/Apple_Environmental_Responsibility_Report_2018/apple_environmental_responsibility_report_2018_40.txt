Eliminating Toxins
The worst toxins and what we’ve  
done about them.
We’re continually evaluating the materials used in products. When we 
identify toxins, we reduce them, remove them, or develop new materials 
that are safer. These efforts also remove toxins from our manufacturing  
and recycling processes, which protects the people who make and take 
apart our products and keeps pollutants out of the land, air, and water.
Beryllium
Eliminated from all new product 
designs. Beryllium is found in copper 
alloys used to make connectors and 
springs.
Mercury
Eliminated in 2009. We use energy-
efficient, mercury-free LEDs and 
OLEDs instead of mercury-based  
fluorescent lamps in all our displays.
Lead
Phased out of display glass and  
solder in 2006.22
Arsenic
Eliminated from display glass since 
2008. Arsenic was traditionally used  
in glass.23
PVC and phthalates
Replaced with safer thermoplastic  
elastomers.24 Both are still used by  
other companies in power cords  
and headphone cables.
Brominated flame retardants (BFRs)
Eliminated from thousands of parts  
such as enclosures, cables, circuit 
boards, and connectors in 2008.  
We use safer metal hydroxides and  
phosphorus compounds in their place.25
