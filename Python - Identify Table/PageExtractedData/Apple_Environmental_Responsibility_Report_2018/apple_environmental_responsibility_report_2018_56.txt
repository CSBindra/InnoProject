Mesa, Arizona 
Our newest data center, our global command center in Mesa, Arizona, came 
online in 2016. To support this facility, we partnered with the local utility, the 
Salt River Project, to build the 50-megawatt Bonnybrooke solar array, which 
became operational in December 2016. This project produces over 147 million 
kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy a year, which more than fully 
matches the energy used by the data center. 
In fiscal year 2017, the Mesa data center was supported by 45 million 
kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used 
by 3,640 Arizona homes.26

Viborg, Denmark 
We’re currently constructing a new data center running on 100 percent 
renewable energy in Denmark’s central Jutland region. Due to its proximity to 
one of Denmark’s largest electrical substations, the data center won’t require 
backup generators, which typically run on diesel and require periodic testing 
and burning of fuel.
