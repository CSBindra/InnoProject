Reno, Nevada 
Unlike competitive energy markets where we’ve located some of our data 
centers, the regulated electricity supply in Nevada did not offer a simple 
solution for us to create new renewable energy projects dedicated to our 
data center. So we created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, 
to develop our first renewable project: the Fort Churchill Solar PV project. 
Apple designed, financed, and constructed the project, and NV Energy 
operates it and directs all the renewable energy it produces to our data 
center. The Fort Churchill Solar PV project uses a new kind of photovoltaic 
panel with curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The 20-megawatt array 
has an annual production capacity of over 43 million kilowatt-hours of clean, 
renewable energy. 
To facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple worked with 
NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to create a green energy 
option open to all commercial customers that does not require the customer 
to fund project development up-front. Thanks to this new option, the 
Nevada Green Rider, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar array: 
a 50-megawatt project called Boulder II. This project came online in 2017, 
producing 137 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy a year. 
In 2017 and early 2018, we used the green energy option two more times. 
Our third Nevada solar array is a 200-megawatt project called Techren 
Solar—Apple‘s largest solar array to date—estimated to produce over  
540 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy a year. And our fourth 
Nevada solar array is the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project producing 
110 million kilowatt-hours a year.
In fiscal year 2017, the Reno data center was supported by projects 
that generated 186 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, which is 
equivalent to the energy used by 16,756 Nevada homes.26
