15Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
As of April 2018, 23 partners have committed to 100 percent renewable 
energy for Apple production: 
• Arkema
• Biel Crystal Manufactory Ltd.
• Catcher Technology
• Compal Electronics
• DSM Engineering Plastics
• ECCO Leather
• Finisar
• Golden Arrow
• Ibiden
• Jabil
• Lens Technology
• Luxshare-ICT
• Mega Precision
• Pegatron
• Qorvo
• Quadrant
• Quanta Computer
• Solvay
• Sunway Communication
• Sunwoda Electronics
• Taiyo Ink Mfg. Co.
• Wistron
• Yuto
In addition to suppliers committed to 100 percent renewable energy for  
Apple production, some have made partial commitments. As of April 2018, 
these commitments represent over 3 gigawatts of new clean energy—well 
on the way to our 4-gigawatt goal. In fact, more than 1 gigawatt is already 
operational and has generated close to 1.9 million kWh of renewable energy 
in fiscal year 2017. This clean energy generation avoided over 1.5 million 
metric tons of CO?e—roughly equivalent to taking more than 300,000 cars 
off the road each year for the life of the renewable energy projects. 
Our supplier clean energy program is helping us to reduce Apple’s 
manufacturing carbon footprint. To maximize the impact of this program, 
we use data from our comprehensive carbon footprint to identify and 
prioritize the most energy-intensive commodities. We then engage with 
suppliers to discuss options for transitioning to renewable energy. In 
important manufacturing regions without strong renewable energy markets, 
we work with suppliers to engage local, regional, and national governments 
to ensure our program is aligned with regulatory priorities. This encourages 
the development of policies that will enable scalable renewable energy 
solutions, including the ability for customers to choose their energy source.

Operational Committed Goal
As of April 2018, 23 suppliers operating in more than 10 different countries have  
committed to 100 percent clean energy for Apple production. Other suppliers  
have also committed to generate or procure clean energy for portions of Apple  
production. In addition, Apple has helped develop 485 megawatts of wind and solar 
projects across six provinces of China to support upstream manufacturing.
