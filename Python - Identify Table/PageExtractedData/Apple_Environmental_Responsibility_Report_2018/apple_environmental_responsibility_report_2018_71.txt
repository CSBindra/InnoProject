Corporate Fiber Footprint Review 
Client: Apple Inc. 2
? Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate 
? Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately 
disclosed 
All results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2017 are plausible. 
2 Reviewed Data and Findings 
As part of this review Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:  
? Calculation methodology for the comprehensive fiber footprint 
? Sales data for FY2017, including accessories 
? Aggregated fiber data for all products and the total comprehensive fiber footprint 
for the fiscal year 2017 
The methodology paper (Fiber Footprint at Apple - Methodology Description - V1.1) 
provided by Apple and reviewed last year, is considered a sound and appropriate guidance 
for determining the comprehensive fiber footprint. Where appropriate, this approach 
follows methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments. 
Plausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail. 
Corrections were made accordingly.This review was done remotely. All questions raised in 
the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided 
where needed.   
Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the 
comprehensive fiber footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of 
fiber data and information. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific 
practice.
