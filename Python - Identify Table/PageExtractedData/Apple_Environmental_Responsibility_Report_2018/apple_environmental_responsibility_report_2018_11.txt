11Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
We apply strong principles for procuring 
renewable energy.
We encounter many legal and regulatory frameworks around the world that 
limit our renewable energy supply options. In each location, we endeavor to 
choose the strongest approach available to us as defined by these guiding 
principles. 
Displacement. We seek to displace more-polluting forms of energy in the 
same electric grid region as our facilities. We accomplish this by having 
Apple-created projects deliver into the grid an amount of renewable energy 
equal to the amount of energy our facilities use from that grid. For less than 
0.5 percent of our load that occurs in difficult renewable energy markets,  
we seek a renewable energy solution in the broader geographic region.
Materiality. We strive to create new clean energy that adds to the energy 
sources already delivering to the grid. This means participating in renewable 
energy projects in a manner that provides material support to the project’s 
success by overcoming financial, regulatory, or other barriers. 
Accountability. We apply rigor in measuring and tracking our energy supply 
resources, and use third-party registries such as WREGIS and NC-RETS, 
certification programs such as Green-e Energy, and contractual provisions 
to ensure that only Apple takes credit for the renewable energy it generates 
or procures. When no such system exists, we work with industry partners 
and governmental entities to create them. 
In China, our solar projects produce 
enough energy to power all our offices 
and retail stores in that country. Solar 
panels are mounted high off the ground 
to let sunlight shine through, so the 
grass can grow—and the local yaks  
can eat it.
