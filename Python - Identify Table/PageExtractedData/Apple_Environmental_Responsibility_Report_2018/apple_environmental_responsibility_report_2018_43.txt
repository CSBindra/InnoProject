43Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
More partnerships. More progress.
We engage with industry, sustainability, and cross-sector organizations to 
share knowledge while learning from subject-matter experts in strategic 
areas. We prioritize associations that share our values, passion, and deeply 
held belief that companies can make a difference. 
Great relationships are built over time. So we have renewed our 
commitments to Ceres, Corporate Eco Forum, the World Business  
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the GreenBiz Executive 
Network, and the Paulson Institute, among others. We are continuing  
our memberships in organizations whose work aligns with our three  
priority areas:
• Climate change. To support our significant investments in renewable 
energy, we’ve continued to work with Advanced Energy Economy 
(AEE), RE100, and We Mean Business. In 2017, we joined several new 
organizations, including the Hawthorn Club to support executive women in 
the renewable energy industry and the Business Environmental Leadership 
Council of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES). We also 
joined the Green Electricity Consumption Cooperative as a Board Member 
Company to support the use of voluntary renewable energy certificates  
in China. 
• Resources. Our work on creating closed-loop material supply chains is 
backed by our memberships with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the 
Aluminum Stewardship Initiative.
• Safer materials. We’re members of the ChemSec Business Group, where  
we work with like-minded companies across a diversity of sectors to 
refine our knowledge of safer materials. And we were founding members 
of Green America’s Clean Electronics Production Network. In 2017, we 
joined the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3) to advance the 
application of green chemistry in product design and supply chains.
