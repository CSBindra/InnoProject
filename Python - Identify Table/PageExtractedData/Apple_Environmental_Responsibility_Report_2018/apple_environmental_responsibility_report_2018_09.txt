9Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Renewable energy. 
We seek to create new renewable energy projects whenever possible. As 
of January 2018, approximately 66 percent of the renewable energy Apple 
procures comes from projects that Apple created. And we aim to ultimately 
cover our entire electricity load with Apple-created projects, which include:
• Direct ownership. Where feasible, we produce our own renewable energy 
by building our own renewable energy projects, including solar arrays,  
wind farms, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro generation systems. 
• Dedicated renewable energy contracts. Where it’s not feasible to build 
our own generation, we sign long-term renewable energy purchase 
contracts, supporting new, local projects that meet our robust renewable 
energy sourcing principles. 
In cases where we need more renewable energy than what’s generated 
by our Apple-created projects, we directly purchase renewable energy 
from newer projects in nearby markets, or through available utility green 
energy programs. When these options are not available, we are willing to 
procure strong renewable energy credits (RECs) tied to recently constructed 
renewable energy projects, applying the same rigor to these purchases as we 
do to our Apple-created renewables. When Apple acquires RECs, we require 
that they are Green-e Energy certified, where available, and come from the 
same power grid—and preferably in the same state or country—as the Apple 
facility they support.
