20Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Products
Our goal is a closed-loop supply chain. 
Traditional supply chains are linear. Materials are mined, manufactured as 
products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts 
over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products. 
This extraction damages our environment and depletes the resources we 
all need to thrive. So in 2017, we announced our commitment to a closed-
loop supply chain—where products are made using recycled or renewable 
materials only. And where we return an equivalent amount of material 
back to the market to be used by us or others. It’s an ambitious goal that 
will require years of collaboration across Apple teams, our suppliers, and 
recyclers—but our work is already underway.
While we transition to this new supply chain model, we are committed to 
maintain our initiatives that ensure the materials we use in our products 
are sourced responsibly—through strict standards and programs that drive 
positive change.

The four aspects of a closed-loop supply chain: 
1. Source: Use recycled or renewable materials that are responsibly sourced. 
2.  Make efficiently: Design and manufacture products to minimize the use  
of materials. 
3.  Use for a long time: Design products to be durable, so they can have  
long lives.
4.  Contribute: Replenish market supply with an amount of recycled, reclaimed, or 
renewable material at least equal to the amount used to make the product.
