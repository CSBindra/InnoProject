N/A = Gas use at colocation facilities are considered outside of Apple’s operational control.
¹  We’ve updated our FY2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple’s operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we’ve removed electricity use associated with  
colocation facility cooling and building operations. This energy use, however, is still covered by renewable energy.
²  We calculate our progress toward 100 percent renewable energy on a calendar year basis. In calendar year 2017, 97 percent of the electricity used at our global facilities was powered by renewable energy. Beginning 
January 1, 2018, we are at 100 percent.
