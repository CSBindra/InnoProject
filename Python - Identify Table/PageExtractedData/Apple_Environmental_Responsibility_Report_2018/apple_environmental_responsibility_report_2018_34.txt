Apple Park—our new headquarters in Cupertino—is the latest example 
of this commitment. The building is on track to be the largest LEED 
Platinum–certified office building in North America. It’s powered by 
100 percent renewable energy, 75 percent of which is generated onsite 
by a 17-megawatt rooftop solar installation and 4 megawatts of baseload 
biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is drawn from the 
nearby California Flats Solar Project. When the building has less use—on 
weekends, for example—it will generate renewable energy that’s delivered 
to the public grid. Over 80 percent of the new campus is open space with 
more than 9000 drought-tolerant trees. Most are oak, and many are shade 
and fruit trees.
At our retail stores, we also apply green building principles. Our new  
back-of-house design is anticipated to reduce our water use by 30 percent 
and our energy load by 40 percent. And whenever possible, we’re bringing 
the outside in, through mixed-mode natural ventilation, and biophilic design, 
in addition to installing rooftop solar systems where conditions allow.
We’ve planted more than 9000 
drought-resistant trees at our new 
campus in Cupertino. We selected 
many tree varieties native to the area 
as well as others that could thrive in 
a range of climate change scenarios.
