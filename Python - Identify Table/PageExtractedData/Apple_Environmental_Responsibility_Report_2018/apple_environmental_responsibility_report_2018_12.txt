Apple and supplier-created long-term renewable  
energy projects.
To reduce our carbon emissions, Apple and our suppliers are generating and procuring renewable energy. The 
map below represents long term investments into new renewable energy projects supporting Apple facilities, 
manufacturing, and cleaner grids around the world.*

To reduce Apple’s own electricity footprint (Scope 2 emissions), we have built or have long-term commitments for renewable 
energy, of  which 626 megawatts is operational and another 775 megawatts is under construction. To address emissions from 
manufacturing products,  Apple and our suppliers have invested or procured 1.1 gigawatts of grid-connected projects, with 
another 1.9 gigawatts in development. These projects apply a mix of clean energy technology—approximately 48 percent wind, 
46 percent solar, 5 percent biomass, and 1 percent  low-impact hydro.
