Packaging Plastic Footprint Review  
Client: Apple Inc. 2 
The two main drivers for the plastic packaging footprint are HIPS (high-impact polystyrene) 
and adhesives.  
All results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2017 are plausible. 
 
2 Reviewed Data and Findings 
As part of this review Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:  
? Calculation methodology for the packaging plastic footprint 
? Sales data for FY2017, including accessories 
? Selected product and supplier specific data on packaging materials and production 
yields  
? Aggregated packaging plastic data for all products and the total packaging plastic 
footprint for the fiscal year 2017 
The methodology paper provided by Apple (Packaging Plastic Footprint at Apple – 
Methodology Description – V1.0) on March 2, 2018, is considered a sound and appropriate 
guidance for determining the packaging plastic footprint. Where appropriate, this 
approach follows methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle 
Assessments.  
This review comprises a check of packaging plastic data for selected products (iPhone, iPad, 
MacBook). For Beats products, it was explained which products where asessed in detail and 
for which products representative data was used. 
Plausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail. 
Corrections were made accordingly. Similarly, scope for the packaging plastic and fibre 
footprint have been discussed. Including ink use of photobooks in future footprints is 
suggested for consistency between plastic and fibre footprint, although the impact on the 
overall packaging plastic footprint is expected to be low.  
This review was done remotely. All questions raised in the course of the review were 
answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.
