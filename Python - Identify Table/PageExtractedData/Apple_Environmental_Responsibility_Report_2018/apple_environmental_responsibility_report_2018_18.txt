18Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Product Transportation/End of Life
We take responsibility for the energy 
used to ship and recycle our products.
We include all the energy used for shipping and recycling in our carbon 
footprint. So we strive to make our packaging smaller or lighter so less 
fuel is consumed when we transport products by air and sea. We’re also 
adjusting our recycling practices. When collecting end-of-life products, 
we maximize the environmental benefits of recycling by weighing the 
availability of recovery technology with the impacts of shipping materials.
The packaging for the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar weighs 19 percent less 
than the previous generation. By designing our packaging to be lighter, we reduce 
emissions from shipping.16
