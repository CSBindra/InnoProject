Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance
Client: Apple Inc. 3
? Regional distribution of sold units and country specific allocation per product to 
major sell-in countries 
? Product specific data on transportation including breakdown of air and sea 
shipment 
? Life cycle GHG emissions for all products, differentiating the actual product 
configurations (i.e. memory capacity) 
? Calculation methodology for the comprehensive carbon footprint and 
methodological changes implemented in 2017 
? The total carbon footprint – scope 3 for the fiscal year 2017 
? Detailed analysis of the comprehensive carbon footprint including: 
o The breakdown of the carbon footprint into life cycle phases 
manufacturing, transportation, product use and recycling 
o Detailed product specific split into life cycle phases 
o The contribution of individual products and product families to the overall 
carbon footprint 
The data and information supporting the GHG assertion were projected (use phase and 
recycling) and historical (i.e. fiscal year 2017 data regarding sales figures, manufacturing, 
transportation). 
This review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall 
carbon footprint. The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions: 
? Are product LCAs referenced correctly? 
? Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible? 
? Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of 
methodological changes as indicated by Apple?  
This review was done remotely. 
3 Findings 
Since the FY2016 Carbon Footprint review in early 2017 6 recent product LCA studies have 
been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44. These LCAs and LCAs reviewed in early
