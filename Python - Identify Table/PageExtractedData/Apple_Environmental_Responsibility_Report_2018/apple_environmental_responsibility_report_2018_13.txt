13Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Reworking how we get to work.
Even as we shrink the carbon footprint of Apple’s facilities, we’re continuing 
to look for ways to reduce carbon emissions from business fleet vehicles, 
employee commute, and business travel. Our total transportation emissions 
fell by 3 percent in fiscal year 2017, while our corporate employee head 
count grew by 9 percent.
Where possible, we enable telecommuting to minimize emissions from 
commuting. For example, our At Home Advisor program provides AppleCare 
customer service by Apple employees working from their homes. This 
program avoided nearly 23,000 metric tons of CO?e emissions in fiscal year 
2017—equal to 13 percent of our employee commute footprint. We also 
offer our U.S. employees a transit subsidy of up to $100 per month, and we 
grew our coach bus program in Santa Clara Valley and China to reduce use 
of single-occupancy vehicles. With the opening of Apple Park, we added 
700 new electric vehicle charging ports, more than 2000 new campus 
bicycles, and a dedicated transit center.

Manufacturing
Transforming our manufacturing process 
to reduce emissions.
Apple takes responsibility for its entire carbon footprint, including emissions 
from manufacturing, transporting, and using and recycling our products. 
These emissions are considered Scope 3 emissions, defined as those 
emissions outside of Apple’s direct control. Manufacturing makes up 
77 percent of our carbon footprint. Most of it is due to carbon emissions 
from the electricity used to make the parts in our products. So we’re 
sourcing lower-carbon materials, partnering with suppliers to reduce their 
energy use, and helping them switch to renewable energy. We believe 
that together we can transform the manufacturing process to dramatically 
reduce emissions.
We’re helping our suppliers switch to renewable energy.
Since the electricity used to make our products is the largest contributor to 
our overall carbon footprint, we’re helping our suppliers reduce their energy 
use and transition to new renewable energy sources.
In 2015, we started engaging directly with suppliers to help them reduce 
their energy use. To this end, we conduct audits and train suppliers to 
uncover opportunities for energy efficiency—like replacing outdated or 
inefficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems; repairing compressed air 
leaks; and recovering waste heat. The assessments provide suppliers with 
a cost-benefit analysis for implementing energy efficiency improvements.  
Carbon emissions per product (kg)
Our efforts to reduce emissions from 
manufacturing products have resulted 
in a per product year-over-year decline 
in carbon emissions.
