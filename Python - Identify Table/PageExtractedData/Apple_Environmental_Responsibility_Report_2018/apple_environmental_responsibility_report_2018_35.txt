Safer Materials
Safer to make. And to use.
We lead the industry in reducing or eliminating the harmful 
substances commonly used in electronics. Through our rigorous 
process of design, testing, and analysis, we’re constantly  
evolving our products and how we make them. So the materials  
we use are safer for the environment, the people who make  
our products, and the people who use them.
