7Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Corporate Facilities
100% renewable energy for 100%  
of our facilities.
In 2018, we reached a major milestone: 100 percent of the electricity we use 
at all of our facilities comes from renewable sources. This outcome is the 
result of the relentless innovation that goes into everything we do—investing 
in our own renewable energy projects and supporting industry-leading 
advances along the way. These efforts have lowered emissions from our 
facilities to 1 percent of our comprehensive carbon footprint.
Scope 1 emissions are those greenhouse gases resulting from fuel 
combustion from sources we own or operate—like vehicles or natural gas 
for heating. Scope 2 emissions refer to those resulting from Apple’s use 
of electricity. Renewable energy generates minimal Scope 2 emissions, 
whereas burning coal, oil, or natural gas to produce electricity releases 
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Since 
2011, our use of renewable energy has reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions by 54 percent and prevented nearly 2.1 million metric tons of 
CO?e from entering the atmosphere. That’s equivalent to taking more than 
444,000 cars off the road each year.? Without renewable energy, these 
emissions would have more than tripled since 2011.
Apple’s emissions (Scopes 1 and 2)
Since 2011, Apple has reduced emissions from our offices, data centers, retail stores, 
and fleet vehicles worldwide by 54 percent—even while our energy use more than 
tripled during this same period.
Our facilities include all of our  
offices, stores, and data centers  
in 43 countries. 
 $2.5 billion
After the U.S. withdrew from the  
Paris climate agreement, Apple 
responded by issuing a $1 billion 
green bond for environmental projects, 
bringing our total to $2.5 billion.
