Waste 
We’re finding new ways to keep old 
materials out of landfills.
We’re committed to making sure all the waste created by our own facilities 
and in our supply chain is reused, recycled, composted, or when necessary, 
converted into energy. Reaching this goal requires collaboration among 
multiple Apple teams, local governments, and specialty recyclers, but 
we’ve already seen great success. In 2015, our facility in Cork, Ireland, 
was the first outside North America to receive UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill 
certification.19 In addition, 22 supplier facilities—including all iPhone final 
assembly sites—have received UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill certification, 
diverting more than 625,000 metric tons of waste from landfills since 
January 2015. 
When first launching our Zero Waste Program for suppliers in 2015, we 
focused our efforts on final assembly sites in China, where most in-process 
packaging waste was being generated in our supply chain. Since those 
facilities have all achieved Zero Waste to Landfill certification, we’ve 
expanded our efforts to include more upstream suppliers. To date, we’ve 
engaged 71 supplier sites. To help our suppliers divert all waste from 
landfills, Apple provides necessary tools and guidance, including the 
services of experts in sustainable waste management.
In 2017, 22 supplier facilities were 
certified as Zero Waste, including all 
our iPhone final assembly sites.
