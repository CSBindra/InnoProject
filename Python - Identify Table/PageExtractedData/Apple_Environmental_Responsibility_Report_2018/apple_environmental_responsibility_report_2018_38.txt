38Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Worker Safety 
High safety standards for the people  
who make our products. 
We also work to protect the health and safety of the people who work in  
our supply chain. The standards we set for our suppliers go far beyond 
what’s required by law, like our Regulated Substances Specification 
(RSS) list, which identifies the toxic chemicals we limit or prohibit in our 
manufacturing processes and products. 
We launched a Chemical Management Program in 2014 to help suppliers 
develop a comprehensive approach to managing chemicals safely. The 
program has grown to 113 participating supplier facilities, and focuses  
on shifting to safer chemicals and improving general safety, awareness,  
and training. 
To better understand the opportunities for greener alternatives, in 2017 we 
mapped the chemicals used in our final assembly facilities and evaluated 
all control measures, such as ventilation, personal protective equipment, 
and worker training programs. The mapping resulted in the identification 
of harmful substances from cleaners at final assembly sites. Hazardous 
chemicals such as methanol, xylene, cyclohexane, acetone, and methyl 
ethyl ketone were replaced with safer alternatives including ethanol, 
isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, and water. We’re continuing to work with our 
suppliers to help them better manage chemicals used in manufacturing.

At all of our final assembly facilities 
in 2017, 100 percent of all process 
chemicals complied with Apple’s 
Regulated Substances Specification.
