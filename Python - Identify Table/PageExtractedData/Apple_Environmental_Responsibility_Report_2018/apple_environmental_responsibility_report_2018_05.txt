Climate Change
We’re making more of an impact 
by making less of one. 
We proved that 100 percent renewable is 100 percent doable.  
All our facilities worldwide—including Apple offices, retail stores, and  
data centers—are now powered entirely by clean energy. But this is  
just the beginning of how we’re reducing greenhouse gas emissions  
that contribute to climate change. We‘re continuing to go further than  
most companies in measuring our carbon footprint, including manufacturing  
and product use. And we’re making great progress in those areas too.
Apple Park is powered by 100 percent 
renewable energy from multiple sources, 
including a 17-megawatt onsite rooftop solar 
installation and 4 megawatts of biogas fuel 
cells. The new headquarters even provides 
clean energy back to the public grid through 
the use of battery storage and a microgrid 
during periods of low occupancy.
