Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance
Client: Apple Inc. 4
2017 cover product segments MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, iPad, and iPhone. These recently 
reviewed LCA studies cover products which represent in total 45,7% of the total scope 3 
carbon footprint. Representatives of other product segments (iPod, MacBook, iMac, Mac 
Pro, Mac Mini, Airport Express / Airport Extreme, Apple TV, and Beats products) underwent 
no or only minor design changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review 
in former years. All reviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 73,5% of the total scope 
3 carbon footprint. 
End-of-life models were updated this year to better reflect actual recycling and disposal of 
packaging materials and products. The reduced carbon footprint of end-of-life processes 
compared to former fiscal years is largely due to this improved modelling approach.   
All questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related 
evidence was provided where needed. 
4 Conclusions 
Apple’ assessment approach is excellent in terms of granularity of the used calculation 
data. A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from 
Apple’s suppliers.  
For all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worst-
case approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative 
estimates.   
The review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data 
level that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The excellent 
analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.
