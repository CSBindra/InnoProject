45Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Showing what we do. Sharing what  
we know. 
We want to share our vision and our work, so we can make a difference well 
beyond Apple’s walls. To increase our impact, over the last year our team 
presented at several notable conferences, meetings, and events, including: 
• 2017 Sustainable Brands conference, where we outlined our ambition to 
create closed-loop material supply chains.
• The Columbia University Global Energy Summit in New York City; 
Washington Post Live—A World in Balance: Solutions for Sustainability; 
and the eighth annual Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM8). At these events, 
we demonstrated how business has the power to influence renewable 
energy markets. 
• Ceres Investor Summit at the United Nations, where we underlined the 
importance of business action and clean energy investment. 
• TechCrunch Disrupt 2017 conference, where we announced that Apple 
is 100 percent renewable in Japan, setting the example for other tech 
industry leaders. 
• GreenBiz VERGE 2017 conference, where we urged the business 
community to take strong action to protect the environment. 
• 2017 Forest Stewardship Council’s General Assembly, where we detailed 
our efforts to reduce our packaging paper footprint. 
• 2017 G20 Resource Efficiency Workshop, where we presented on Apple‘s 
efforts to reduce dependence on finite resources. 
In addition, we published a number of papers to offer insight into how we’re 
innovating on environmental challenges. These include a white paper about 
the work we are doing to source paper responsibly and a collaboration with 
RE100 about our supplier clean energy program. 
At the 2017 Women’s Forum for  
the Economy and Society in Paris,  
Lisa Jackson discussed Apple’s  
global impact through environmental  
leadership and how our values drive  
our business.
