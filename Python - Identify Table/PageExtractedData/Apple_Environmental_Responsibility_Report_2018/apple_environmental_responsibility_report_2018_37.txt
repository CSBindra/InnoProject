37Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Since we built our own Environmental 
Testing Lab in 2006, we’ve grown it to 
over 30 times its original size.
To understand the safety of our materials more comprehensively, we started 
our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program to identify all the substances  
in all the parts in all our products. So far, we’ve collected the composition  
of more than 25,000 individual components out of the 50,000 present in our 
products, and we get data on more parts every day. We’ve also collected 
FMDs covering over half of the mass of iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and  
iPhone X. We’re prioritizing materials with the greatest risks, such as those 
used in high quantities or those with the greatest human exposure. 
We apply our most rigorous controls to the materials that are in prolonged 
skin contact. Our toxicologists review results from our testing and use 
FMDs to generate comprehensive hazard and risk assessments including 
GreenScreen®, which considers 18 different criteria to help us understand the 
materials‘ effect on people’s health and on the environment. Only materials 
that pass our rigorous review process are accepted for our products.
