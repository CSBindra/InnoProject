31Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Supplier water use.
We’re focused on the water used by suppliers to make our products. 
In 2013, we established the Clean Water Program to help our suppliers 
conserve water and prevent water pollution. We put a special emphasis  
on working with suppliers with high water usage and in water stressed 
regions, as well as makers of components that our life cycle water 
assessments have identified as particularly water-intensive. 
Through employee training, baseline assessments, performance 
evaluations, and technical support, we helped our suppliers conserve  
more than 5.1 billion gallons of water in 2017 alone, increasing average  
water reuse to 37 percent across 106 facilities. And since many of our 
suppliers also build components for other companies, we’re reducing  
the water footprint of non-Apple products too.
Corporate water use.
At our offices, data centers, and retail stores across the world, we monitor 
our cooling, landscaping, and sanitation water use so we can develop 
targeted ways to conserve water. In fiscal year 2017, Apple used about  
1 billion gallons of water directly, a 59 percent increase over the previous 
year. This increase was driven by extraordinary growth in our data center 
services, research and development activities, and temporary water 
uses like new construction, and establishment of mature trees at Apple 
Park. These temporary water uses represented 80 million gallons—nearly 
10 percent of our water footprint. In addition, we have expanded our water 
footprint to include colocation facilities and distribution centers for the first 
time, which together amount to 159 million gallons of water, or 16 percent 
of our total footprint. 
Water use at Apple facilities
We calculate our corporate water use  for our data centers, retail stores, and  
corporate offices.

Since 2013, we’ve helped our  
suppliers save more than 13.6 billion 
gallons of water—enough to provide 
every person on the planet with  
almost 30 glasses of water.
Starting in 2017, we‘re including as part of Apple‘s footprint, water use at distribution 
centers and colocation facilities.
