46Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Speaking up for stronger policies. 
We believe it’s important to defend the best ideas and to amplify our beliefs. 
And to speak out when our voice will have a powerful impact: 
• In June 2017, Apple urged the White House to remain in the Paris climate 
agreement, to retain American leadership, and to take meaningful action 
on climate change. 
• In November 2017, Apple joined a number of other companies urging the 
government of Vietnam to make regulatory changes allowing companies  
to procure renewable energy through direct power purchase agreements. 
• In January 2018, Apple filed comments to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, urging it not to finalize a rulemaking that would subsidize 
fossil fuels, which would limit the ability of renewables to compete in the 
electricity market. FERC chose not to finalize that rule. 
• In February 2018, Apple filed comments with the Japanese government, 
calling for the development of a robust and verifiable renewable energy 
trading system that would help accelerate the deployment of renewable 
generation in Japan. 
• And in April 2018, we filed individual comments to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, urging it not to repeal the Clean Power Plan because of 
its importance in reducing emissions in the United States.
