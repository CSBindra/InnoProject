14Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
We aim to promote continual improvement, build technical capabilities,  
and increase awareness of the environmental and financial benefits of 
energy efficiency. 
Since the inception of this program in 2015, we have engaged with 
48 suppliers at 71 facilities. In 2017, our program implemented energy 
efficiency measures that saved a combined annualized $44.8 million. 
These measures helped save an annualized 320,000 metric tons of CO?e 
from entering the atmosphere in 2017.
Our efforts go beyond energy efficiency to spur the development and 
procurement of renewable energy within our global supply chain. Partners 
across our supply chain are installing or investing in sizable solar projects, 
running their factories on 100 percent wind power, and purchasing 
clean energy from reputable utility programs. We’ve also helped develop 
485 megawatts of wind and solar projects to address upstream emissions. 
As part of our clean energy program, Apple and our suppliers will generate 
and procure more than 4 gigawatts of new clean power worldwide by 2020. 
Once completed, this will represent approximately one-third of our current 
manufacturing carbon footprint.
4 gigawatts = one-third of our  
manufacturing emissions
By 2020, Apple and our suppliers will 
generate or procure 4 gigawatts of 
clean energy in our supply chain.  
That’s approximately one-third of our 
current manufacturing footprint.
Our partner Compal, which assembles 
iPad devices, is constructing rooftop 
solar on its facilities across China. By 
the end of 2018, it will achieve its goal 
of 100 percent renewable energy for 
Apple production.
