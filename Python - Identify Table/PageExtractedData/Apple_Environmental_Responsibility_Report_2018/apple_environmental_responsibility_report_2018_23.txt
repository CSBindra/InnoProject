23Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Our intention is to install Daisy in multiple locations around the world— 
starting with the United States and Europe. Daisy will process end-of-life  
iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s,  
iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus devices that are returned to  
us by customers or via AppleCare. The program’s success depends in  
part on customers returning their end-of-life devices to Apple, so we are 
launching Apple GiveBack to make it easier for them to do so. 
A durable device is a greener device. 
When products can be used longer, fewer resources need to be extracted 
from the earth to make new ones. So we assess all our products in our 
Reliability Testing Lab, using rigorous testing methods that simulate 
customers’ experiences with their devices. For example, we analyze how 
devices stand up to extreme heat and cold, exposure to water and everyday 
chemicals, and scratch tests from materials like denim and metal coins. All 
new materials, including recycled materials, are tested extensively to make 
sure they meet our performance and durability standards. If a product does 
require repair, Apple and its authorized service providers provide repair 
services and parts for five years after the product is no longer manufactured 
- or longer where required by law. 
In our Reliability Testing Lab, one of 
the tests uses a weighted pendulum 
that simulates a swinging arm hitting 
Apple Watch against a hard object.
