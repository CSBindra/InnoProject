10Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Key innovations in creating or  
procuring our renewable energy.
Innovation played a key role in how we contracted and built projects to 
help us reach 100 percent renewable energy starting in 2018*.

2011: Our 20-megawatt solar PV project in North Carolina was the first utility-scale 
project built and owned by a non-energy commercial company. We minimized our 
risk by leveraging the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which we 
then used for five more projects in North Carolina and Oregon.
2012: We began using Direct Access to purchase renewable energy from  
independent power producers, rather than the local utility for our Oregon and 
California data centers. We also now use it to supply renewables from projects  
we own ourselves: Solar Star Oregon II and California Flats PV.
2013: We worked with the local utility in Reno to create the Nevada Green Rider— 
a regulatory structure that allows us to enter into long-term contracts with new 
renewable energy projects. 
2014: We created a first-of-its-kind joint venture in Sichuan to make an equity 
investment in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects to cover electricity use at our 
Chinese corporate offices, retail stores, and data storage.
2015: In Singapore, where we have a retail store and corporate campus, we put 
solar PV panels on more than 800 rooftops, and used the Singaporean version of 
Direct Access to deliver that power to our facilities.
2016: We identified an economical way to generate new renewable energy in Japan, 
despite its difficult regulatory rules, by installing over 300 solar PV rooftop systems 
connected to the grid using a low-voltage tariff.
2017: We installed 17 megawatts of onsite rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of 
biogas fuel cells, along with a microgrid and battery storage, at Apple Park, our  
new corporate campus. 
2018: We contracted for renewable energy generation in new markets like India, 
Turkey, Israel, Brazil, and Mexico to cover our remaining loads in those and  
neighboring countries. 
2019+: Beyond 2018, we will continue to innovate to expand our use of  
renewable energy as our electricity needs grow. We’ll continue to explore new  
markets and invest in energy storage—an essential element in our transition to 
renewable energy.
*We achieved our 100 percent renewable energy goal beginning January 1, 2018.
