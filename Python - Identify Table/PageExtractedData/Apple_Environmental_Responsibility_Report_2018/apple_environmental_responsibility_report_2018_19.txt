Resources
 Rethinking materials. 
We’re always thinking of ways to use fewer of the earth’s  
precious resources and ways to use them again. Like recovering more 
of the high-quality materials in your old devices to make new products. 
Through more efficient recycling technologies and other innovations, 
we hope that one day we can stop mining the earth altogether.
