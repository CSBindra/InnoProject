Among Maiden’s energy efficiency features is the use of outside air cooling 
through a waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours, 
which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be turned off more 
than 75 percent of the time.

Newark, California
Our data center in Newark, California, is powered by 100 percent renewable 
energy. We hit this milestone in January 2013, when we began serving the 
data center with energy sourced primarily from California wind power. We’re 
acquiring this energy directly from the wholesale market through California’s 
Direct Access program. Late in 2017, Apple’s 130-megawatt California Flats 
solar project in Monterey County, California, came online, and now we use 
Direct Access to supply power from that project directly to our data center 
as well as other Apple facilities in California. 
In fiscal year 2017, the Newark data center was supported by projects  
that generated 118 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, which is 
equivalent to the energy used by 17,976 California homes.26
