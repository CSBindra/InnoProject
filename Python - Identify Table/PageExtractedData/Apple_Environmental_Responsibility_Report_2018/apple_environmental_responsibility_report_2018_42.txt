Better Together
Leading and listening 
in equal measure.
A single company cannot solve the world’s challenges alone.  
So Apple engages across sectors, listens to diverse perspectives, 
and shares the latest research to identify solutions. 
In this past year, we’ve continued our focus on inspiring others, 
influencing public policy, and helping to improve global 
outcomes. We’ve deepened our engagement with well-respected 
organizations, collaborated with peer organizations, publicly 
shared our vision and our journey, and supported legislative 
efforts through advocacy.
