Looking for toxins.
Laser-Induced Breakdown 
Spectroscopy is one process we  
use to analyze the materials that  
go into our products and detect  
certain harmful substances,  
such as beryllium. 
Updating the lab with state- 
of-the-art equipment.
With the addition of gas and liquid 
chromatography mass spectrometry 
instruments, we can screen for 
even more substances of concern 
that aren’t explicitly targeted in our 
standard material evaluation process.
Ensuring the safety of Apple Watch.
We test all our products, and place  
special attention on materials that  
come in contact with skin. In our  
nickel leach testing on Apple Watch,  
we place different components in jars  
of artificial sweat to ensure the nickel 
in the stainless steel alloy stays where 
it belongs.
