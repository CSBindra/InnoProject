17Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
Product Use
Since 2008, we’ve reduced the  
average energy consumed by Apple 
products by 68 percent.11 
When we measure our carbon footprint, we even include the energy 
consumers use to run their devices. And we continue to make 
advancements in our products’ efficiency. For example, iMac consumes  
up to 96 percent less energy in sleep mode than the first generation.  
The 12-inch MacBook uses less than 0.5 watt in sleep mode. And  
you can charge your iPhone X once a day for a year for only 75 cents.12  
When you multiply these reductions by all the Apple devices in the 
world, the impact on our carbon footprint really adds up.
61%
MacBook Pro consumes 61 percent  
less energy than the original 
MacBook Pro with Retina display.13
40% 
iMac Pro consumes 40 percent  
less power during sleep and off  
mode—the result of an innovation 
in power supply design.14
 96%
iMac consumes up to 96 percent  
less energy in sleep mode than  
the first generation.
 9 watts
When playing music, HomePod  
consumes less power than an  
average LED lightbulb.15
Product energy use (kWh/yr)
Over time, the average energy 
our products use compared with 
previous generations has declined.
