Comprehensive Carbon Footprint
We measure more. So we can do more.
When we measure our carbon footprint, we don’t stop with ourselves.  
We include hundreds of suppliers, millions of customers, and hundreds of 
millions of devices. And we’re always looking for ways to make the biggest 
difference in five major areas: corporate facilities, manufacturing, product 
use, transportation, and end-of-life processing. In 2017, we once again 
reduced our overall carbon footprint to 27.5 million metric tons of greenhouse 
gases (CO?e). That‘s down from 29.5 million metric tons in 2016. 
Our environmental programs contributed to this decline in our comprehensive 
carbon footprint, including reduced emissions from aluminum manufacturing, 
energy efficiency, and increasing use of clean energy at our facilities and  
in our supply chain. We also refine our product life cycle analysis each year, 
moving from industry-average data to our own data whenever possible. 
(See Appendix A to read more about our life cycle carbon analysis.)

Our carbon footprint tells us a lot about how we’re doing and where there are opportunities to go further. For example, 
because aluminum represents almost a quarter of our manufacturing emissions, we developed a program to reduce emissions 
associated with aluminum enclosures.
