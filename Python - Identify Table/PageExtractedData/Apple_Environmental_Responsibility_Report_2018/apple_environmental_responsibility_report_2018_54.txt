Prineville, Oregon
To support our Prineville data center, we recently signed a 200-megawatt 
power purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the Montague 
Wind Power Project, set to come online by the end of 2019. This is our first 
Apple-created wind project. And it’s our largest project to date, producing 
over 560 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy a year. 
Additionally, we executed a power purchase agreement for the 
56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II PV array located just a few miles from our 
data center, which came online and began supporting the data center in 
2017. The project produces 140 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy 
a year. To strengthen the connection between Apple and these projects, 
we use Oregon’s Direct Access program to schedule the renewable energy 
from these projects directly to our data center. 
Also supporting the data center are two micro-hydro projects that harness 
the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals that have been 
operating for over 60 years. These micro-hydro projects generate 12 million 
kilowatt-hours of renewable energy a year. 
Supplementing these projects, and ensuring we remain 100 percent 
renewable all the time, we executed a long-term purchase agreement 
with Cypress Creek Renewables for all environmental attributes from a 
50-megawatt portfolio of six solar arrays in Oregon. 
In fiscal year 2017, the Prineville data center was supported by projects 
that generated 195 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, which is 
equivalent to the energy used by 17,916 Oregon homes.26
