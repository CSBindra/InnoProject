Data Center Energy 
Supplement
 
 
Apple’s data center presence continues to grow—since April 2017, we 
announced a new U.S. data center in Iowa, a second data center in 
Denmark, and two new data centers in China. 
Each Apple data center has unique design features that reflect the climate 
and other aspects of its specific site. All of our data centers operate on  
100 percent renewable energy and power billions of iMessages, answers 
from Siri, and song downloads from iTunes. This means that no matter how 
much data the facilities handle, there is a zero greenhouse gas emissions 
impact from their electricity use. These data centers use renewable energy 
sources like solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro power from 
onsite and locally obtained resources. 
Maiden, North Carolina
Between 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 megawatts of Apple-created 
projects: two 20-megawatt solar arrays, an 18-megawatt solar array, and 
10 megawatts of biogas fuel cells. In 2015, we partnered with the local utility, 
Duke Energy, to help build five solar PV projects through Duke Energy’s 
Green Source Rider program. These solar PV projects, which started coming 
online in late 2015, were Duke Energy’s first Green Source Rider projects 
to become operational. We worked with Duke Energy for several years to 
develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple and Duke 
Energy to work together to develop new renewable energy projects. The 
five projects have a combined peak capacity of 20 megawatts. In 2017, we 
also made long-term commitments to five more solar PV projects in North 
Carolina, for an additional 86 megawatts of clean energy. All told, in fiscal 
year 2017, the Maiden data center was supported by projects that generated 
273 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the 
energy used by 20,663 North Carolina homes.26
