16Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017
We know the transition to renewable energy can be highly complex. It often 
requires complicated deal structures across many regions with their own 
regulatory requirements. So in 2017, Apple developed the Clean Energy 
Portal, an online platform to help suppliers identify commercially viable 
renewable energy solutions in regions around the world. We will continue to 
share new resources on the Clean Energy Portal, intended to make adoption 
of clean energy in key markets even easier. We continually update policy 
guidance and tools to help suppliers develop commercially viable strategies 
to achieve 100 percent renewable energy.
We’re reducing our manufacturing emissions 
by prioritizing aluminum that was smelted 
using hydroelectricity rather than fossil fuels, 
and we reengineered our manufacturing  
process to reincorporate scrap aluminum.
Lowering emissions by focusing on aluminum.
Emissions associated with aluminum manufacturing across all Apple 
products represent 24 percent of our manufacturing carbon footprint.  
So we prioritized aluminum that was smelted using hydroelectricity rather 
than fossil fuels, and we reengineered our manufacturing process to 
reincorporate the scrap aluminum. As a result, over the past three years 
we’ve reduced emissions associated with every gram of aluminum in  
iPhone by 83 percent. And for the enclosure of the 13-inch MacBook Pro 
with Touch Bar, it’s a 47 percent reduction compared to that of the previous-
generation MacBook Pro.10
?2.6 million
Changes to aluminum production and 
suppliers transitioning to renewable 
energy cut our greenhouse gas  
emissions by 2.6 million metric tons 
in fiscal year 2017.?
