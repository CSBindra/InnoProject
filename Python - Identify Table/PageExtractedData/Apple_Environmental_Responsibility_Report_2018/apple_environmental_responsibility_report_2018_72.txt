Packaging Plastic Footprint Review  
Client: Apple Inc. 1 
Review Statement 
Packaging Plastic Footprint 
Fraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple’s packaging plastic footprint data related to packaging 
plastic usage from products and retail operations in fiscal year 2017.  
 
1 Summary 
This review checks transparency of data and calculations, appropriateness of supporting 
product and packaging related data and assumptions, and overall plausibility of the 
calculated annual packaging plastic footprint of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2017 
and of retail operations in the same period.  
As there is no standardised method available for calculating a packaging plastic footprint 
Apple defined a methodology for internal use. The scope of the plastic packaging footprint 
includes Apple’s packaging plastic usage from products and retail operations. The 
packaging plastic footprint tracks the total amount of plastic, adhesives, and ink, that 
Apple uses in packaging. Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each product 
line and sums up these figures for the entire company using sell-in numbers. The output is 
a total packaging plastic footprint.  
The review of the annual packaging plastic footprint has considered the following criteria: 
? The system boundaries are clearly defined 
? Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate 
? Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately 
disclosed 
Data reported by Apple is as follows: 
 Total Plastic 
2017 24,000 
 [metric tons plastic]
